28
00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:37.849
john bianculli: Oh, the other proposal that I have for you guys, too.

29
00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:43.409
john bianculli: The app is basically for people that are a recovery tool. Correct.

30
00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:46.650
Dolores Albarracin: For people, sorry.

31
00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:49.500
john bianculli: Yes, yeah. For people in recovery, like a sports system.

32
00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:50.950
Dolores Albarracin: No, not all.

33
00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:52.519
john bianculli: Oh, okay.

34
00:01:53.350 --> 00:02:04.639
Dolores Albarracin: No, actually, we have people who are in recovery, or, you know, have some struggle with substances, but half of.

35
00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:07.449
john bianculli: Well, I mean, I know people that are in recovery because I'm in a rehab.

36
00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:11.670
john bianculli: Did you need any more people using the app that are in recovery?

37
00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:18.070
Dolores Albarracin: Do we need more people? Now?

38
00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:19.330
Dolores Albarracin: Yeah, do you.

39
00:02:20.067 --> 00:02:22.280
john bianculli: I'm in rehab.

40
00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:23.680
john bianculli: So.

41
00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:26.380
Dolores Albarracin: It's probably about another 10 or 12 people

42
00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:34.500
Dolores Albarracin: who could who can use it. Yes, I I think that's a it's a good question

43
00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:41.589
Dolores Albarracin: I have to ask where we are with that at some point that we're gonna open it up. But

44
00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:48.170
Dolores Albarracin: we just actually finished enrolling for this study. Otherwise I would say.

45
00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:51.690
Dolores Albarracin: well, we need people for the study. So

46
00:02:51.700 --> 00:03:01.500
Dolores Albarracin: we've always encouraged people. But definitely, let's let's make a note of this to to let John know where we are.

47
00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.059
Dolores Albarracin: Yeah, in terms of.

48
00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:08.630
john bianculli: Yeah before the 29, th because that's whenever I leave California to go back to Pittsburgh.

49
00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:10.590
Dolores Albarracin: Right.

50
00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:13.100
john bianculli: So I'm gonna be in recovery till the 29.th

51
00:03:14.376 --> 00:03:16.730
Dolores Albarracin: After that I'll be back in Pittsburgh.

52
00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:34.710
Dolores Albarracin: Okay, yes, but not everybody. You know, it's sort of half and half. It's just people from the community at large. And yeah, different concerns and things. And they want to change. But I wanna welcome all of you.

53
00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:40.940
Dolores Albarracin: especially Crystal, who we we couldn't really hear last week.

54
00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:52.729

67
00:04:54.470 --> 00:05:08.119
Dolores Albarracin: interesting to me to get to meet you all. Quite closely and and to learn from you. And yeah, I'll be essentially facilitating these sessions.

68
00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:18.340
Dolores Albarracin: So I see. Well, John, why why don't you just do a very brief intro? So Crystal gets to know you.

76
00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:53.709
john bianculli: Thank you, and I also did my homework that you told me to do. Remember how you gave everybody homework. I got a case worker, and I think I'm gonna have an apartment. Whenever I think they help me find a an apartment, for whenever I get back.

77
00:05:53.710 --> 00:06:02.230
Dolores Albarracin: Well, we'll we'll talk about this for sure. Yes. Petra, do you want to introduce yourself for Crystal?

78
00:06:03.094 --> 00:06:12.225
Petra Teeter 237121: Yes, I'm sorry I had my microphone off, because our garbage is being picked up, and it's really loud, and I wasn't sure if you all had to listen to that.

79
00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:17.330
Petra Teeter 237121: So I live in the Raleigh North Carolina area.

80
00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:23.730

83
00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:41.900
Petra Teeter 237121: Well, the suns are here often, but

84
00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:48.120
Petra Teeter 237121: well, not that often. They kind of live here. They're mostly not here.

85
00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:58.170
Petra Teeter 237121: so there you go, but it's all good to make it work as a family. And I actually like having them around so.

86
00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:02.480
Dolores Albarracin: Thank you. Frank.

87

00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:37.778
Frank: And yeah, I don't know what else to say about myself, but that's me in a nutshell.

94
00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:12.880
Dolores Albarracin: Okay, well, last week we talked about the really critical issue of of.

95
00:08:13.090 --> 00:08:22.080
Dolores Albarracin: do we want to change anything in our relationships? Maybe get to see somebody we haven't seen in a long time.

96
00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:29.749
Dolores Albarracin: maybe make some type of change to a relationship. And and most of you

97
00:08:30.790 --> 00:08:35.260
Dolores Albarracin: it was something, and they they wanted to change.

98
00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:41.269
Dolores Albarracin: I think Pat was going to go Christmas shopping right.

99
00:08:41.270 --> 00:08:45.319
Patricia Renaud: Yeah, I did. And I actually got it all done. So.

100
00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:47.700
Dolores Albarracin: I said it was.

101
00:08:47.700 --> 00:08:49.667
Patricia Renaud: Really it was fun.

102
00:08:50.930 --> 00:08:57.430
Patricia Renaud: I had time off. I didn't have the grandkids, so I actually went by myself and made a day of it.

103
00:08:58.360 --> 00:09:00.139
Dolores Albarracin: When did you go?

104
00:09:01.257 --> 00:09:04.242
Patricia Renaud: I went on. Saturday and

105
00:09:05.100 --> 00:09:12.820
Patricia Renaud: I went to a local mall. We don't have very many stores left around here, but one Mall around us is doing quite well.

106
00:09:14.870 --> 00:09:23.860
Patricia Renaud: sat down, had lunch, took my time, just, you know, made a day of it, and got everything I needed to for everybody, and

107
00:09:23.890 --> 00:09:25.749
Patricia Renaud: it was a great day.

108
00:09:25.910 --> 00:09:29.780
Dolores Albarracin: And were you able to forget about your son and and.

109
00:09:29.780 --> 00:09:30.570
Patricia Renaud: Yep.

110
00:09:30.570 --> 00:09:32.649
Dolores Albarracin: No. Partner, yeah.

111
00:09:32.650 --> 00:09:33.690
Patricia Renaud: Exactly.

112
00:09:33.690 --> 00:09:35.340
Dolores Albarracin: For how many hours.

113
00:09:36.264 --> 00:09:38.510
Patricia Renaud: It was probably around 6 h.

114
00:09:38.510 --> 00:09:38.940
Dolores Albarracin: Wow!

115
00:09:38.940 --> 00:09:43.379
Patricia Renaud: I left in the morning about 10 o'clock, and was home around 4 30.

116
00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:44.080
Patricia Renaud: So.

117
00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:53.639
Dolores Albarracin: And and were people at home or in your family surprised that you had done this.

118
00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:58.329
Patricia Renaud: Actually I was thinking about it, you know.

119
00:09:58.930 --> 00:10:02.280
Patricia Renaud: just to have people not around me. So

120
00:10:02.330 --> 00:10:09.980
Patricia Renaud: nobody saw anything that you know they're going to see before Christmas. So I was thinking about it. But

121
00:10:10.100 --> 00:10:14.190
Patricia Renaud: putting it into, you know, reality and doing it actually was

122
00:10:14.210 --> 00:10:16.720
Patricia Renaud: another thing. So I'm glad I did it.

123
00:10:17.620 --> 00:10:25.929
Dolores Albarracin: So any comments from the group on on pads like this this past week.

124
00:10:28.630 --> 00:10:35.855
Petra Teeter 237121: I didn't do anything special, but it doesn't mean that I wasn't, you know, happy or content.

125
00:10:36.540 --> 00:10:41.289
Petra Teeter 237121: I was gonna say something, and most of you are gonna dislike it, and it's all right.

126
00:10:43.190 --> 00:10:52.439
Petra Teeter 237121: Since our I grew up in a family where it was always a disaster. Every Christmas

127
00:10:53.060 --> 00:10:57.870
Petra Teeter 237121: my father would give my mother something like

128
00:10:58.200 --> 00:11:01.019
Petra Teeter 237121: a kitchen appliance, and she would start crying.

129
00:11:01.470 --> 00:11:04.849
Petra Teeter 237121: She was like, That's not! That's not a gift that right.

130
00:11:04.860 --> 00:11:14.529
Petra Teeter 237121: and she would give him something like, I don't know a shirt or something, and he would be unhappy, and I hated that so much as a child

131
00:11:14.700 --> 00:11:27.079
Petra Teeter 237121: that when I had when we had our own own children, and they were old enough to understand. We brought it up, and I remember, though the older one was 11, and the younger 1 9.

132
00:11:27.260 --> 00:11:33.270
Petra Teeter 237121: And we said, Well, do you really want just presents for for Christmas?

133
00:11:33.540 --> 00:11:36.299
Petra Teeter 237121: And and they were like, no, you give us

134
00:11:36.410 --> 00:11:43.150
Petra Teeter 237121: items we need all year long, even the ones we just want and and Nope

135
00:11:43.480 --> 00:11:52.868
Petra Teeter 237121: and and they didn't ask for much to begin with. And so we just completely stopped that with that in just the 4 of us and

136
00:11:53.340 --> 00:11:56.549
Petra Teeter 237121: I've gotten quite some criticism from.

137
00:11:56.920 --> 00:11:57.779
Dolores Albarracin: For for sure.

138
00:11:58.990 --> 00:12:09.070
Dolores Albarracin: Maybe you can. Maybe you can take some advice. From Pat. Yeah. Christmas shopping. But I meant I mean pat

139
00:12:10.060 --> 00:12:20.669
Petra Teeter 237121: Yeah, I just bring that up because I know it's different, and probably mostly everybody thinks, oh, that's horrible. But you! If if you heard my son did.

140
00:12:20.690 --> 00:12:31.840
Petra Teeter 237121: and they had to fight through this in school with other kids at the time they'd be. I overheard the conversation, and they were like, no, I've got everything I want and need. I don't need anything.

141
00:12:32.010 --> 00:12:34.020
Petra Teeter 237121: and I thought that was the funniest thing.

142
00:12:34.020 --> 00:12:34.659
Dolores Albarracin: Yeah, but.

143
00:12:34.660 --> 00:12:36.399
Petra Teeter 237121: There wasn't anything that I I.

144
00:12:36.400 --> 00:12:36.750
Dolores Albarracin: And.

145
00:12:36.750 --> 00:12:37.529
Petra Teeter 237121: Or make no sense.

146
00:12:37.530 --> 00:12:37.950
Dolores Albarracin: And.

147
00:12:37.950 --> 00:12:38.370
Petra Teeter 237121: So.

148
00:12:38.370 --> 00:12:49.520
Dolores Albarracin: Yeah, what I what I meant was, really, I mean, if people notice something, I think Pat looks a lot more relaxed having done this than how she was feeling about.

149
00:12:49.900 --> 00:12:52.560
Petra Teeter 237121: She enjoyed it so. Yes, absolutely.

150
00:12:53.070 --> 00:12:55.470
Dolores Albarracin: Yeah, that's great. Morgan.

151
00:12:55.740 --> 00:12:57.479
Patricia Renaud: It pays to pay. Time

152
00:12:57.900 --> 00:13:03.539
Patricia Renaud: pays to take time for yourself now and then, you know and forget about all the other problems.

153
00:13:04.030 --> 00:13:08.840
Dolores Albarracin: Again. Sorry I'm a little late. I just got home from work. It looks like I'm still muted.

154
00:13:09.520 --> 00:13:13.220
Dolores Albarracin: You're not. You're you're not muted, but we cannot see you.

155
00:13:13.430 --> 00:13:15.360
Morgan Potts: And I'm trying to figure that out.

156
00:13:15.360 --> 00:13:21.670
Dolores Albarracin: So there is a little icon on on the bottom left. So there is a microphone and a little camera

157
00:13:22.240 --> 00:13:26.389
Dolores Albarracin: click on the camera. You should be visible to us.

158
00:13:26.750 --> 00:13:28.240
Morgan Potts: Okay, there, you got it.

159
00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:47.470
Dolores Albarracin: Yeah, okay, well, good to see you. So yeah, we're going through what everybody did. And Pat actually went Christmas shopping for 6 h without worrying about her son and fiance or or girlfriend, and and so on.

160
00:13:47.490 --> 00:14:03.370
Dolores Albarracin: So yeah. And and, John, you, you were telling us in in the beginning that you actually got a case manager and and quite a setup for your return. Why don't you tell us how? How was that? What did you do.

161
00:14:04.520 --> 00:14:10.749
john bianculli: Well, I mean, well, basically, I called an organization

162
00:14:11.330 --> 00:14:18.550
john bianculli: central outreach. They referred me. They had a bunch of numbers. I put their number in the chat.

163
00:14:19.030 --> 00:14:25.859
john bianculli: and in case anybody needs either free condoms free Std. Testing, if they live in either Pennsylvania or or Ohio.

164
00:14:26.100 --> 00:14:32.370
john bianculli: they also give you free prep. If you qualify to help prevent the spread of HIV

165
00:14:33.470 --> 00:14:40.370
john bianculli: if they're they're a good organization. But they found another organization that focuses on trying to get housing for people coming out of rehab.

166
00:14:41.250 --> 00:14:47.730
john bianculli: So I mean, I hit all the the marks. I've had a job for 11 years no felonies.

167
00:14:48.200 --> 00:14:52.340
john bianculli: So my friend's going to investigate the apartment tomorrow.

168
00:14:52.860 --> 00:14:59.630
john bianculli: and then I find out what I'm hoping how it's going to work out. I jump off the plane, get my new keys, sign the lease, and

169
00:15:00.210 --> 00:15:01.449
john bianculli: start from there.

170
00:15:01.690 --> 00:15:07.679
Dolores Albarracin: And you'll be set and are. Are. Is your plan to go back to work? Remind us, remind me of.

171
00:15:07.680 --> 00:15:08.190
john bianculli: Yes.

172
00:15:08.190 --> 00:15:10.200
Dolores Albarracin: Add, yeah, yeah.

173
00:15:10.200 --> 00:15:11.610
john bianculli: December the second.

174
00:15:12.370 --> 00:15:13.340
Dolores Albarracin: Okay.

175
00:15:13.560 --> 00:15:17.069
john bianculli: December the second. So I'm coming back from Rehab on the 29.th

176
00:15:17.695 --> 00:15:22.080
john bianculli: I did make sure to plan a meeting for the 29.th

177
00:15:22.390 --> 00:15:25.469
john bianculli: Yeah, the 1st day I get back to Pittsburgh to be on the safe side.

178
00:15:27.116 --> 00:15:32.663
john bianculli: I know where the meetings at already. Yeah, I mean Pittsburgh. I know where I'm at. But

179
00:15:33.655 --> 00:15:40.040
john bianculli: yeah. So I get back in Pittsburgh mid mid Friday.

180
00:15:40.220 --> 00:15:43.830
john bianculli: and I'm gonna go to this night, owl meeting that they have on the south side.

181
00:15:45.090 --> 00:15:48.560
john bianculli: So I wanted to make sure I planned a meeting, for when I got out the plane.

182
00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:52.640
john bianculli: just to make sure now.

183
00:15:52.640 --> 00:15:52.980
Dolores Albarracin: No.

184
00:15:52.980 --> 00:15:54.910
john bianculli: That I changed my housing at.

185
00:15:55.270 --> 00:15:58.420
john bianculli: I'm a little bit more careful about where I put myself at.

186
00:15:59.080 --> 00:15:59.750
Dolores Albarracin: The last.

187
00:15:59.750 --> 00:16:01.574
john bianculli: Place that was out.

188
00:16:02.820 --> 00:16:05.700
john bianculli: The affordable housing act good and bad.

189
00:16:06.880 --> 00:16:09.850
john bianculli: Imagine you're paying $2,000 a month

190
00:16:10.090 --> 00:16:13.889
john bianculli: next to somebody that is paying $300 a month and unemployed.

191
00:16:14.300 --> 00:16:19.139
john bianculli: So with that building, it was really hard to keep sober and behave yourself.

192
00:16:20.640 --> 00:16:23.059
john bianculli: That's the best way to know how to put it.

193
00:16:23.580 --> 00:16:24.640
Dolores Albarracin: So the next.

194
00:16:24.640 --> 00:16:26.620
john bianculli: And I'm trying to take place in the verbs.

195
00:16:29.340 --> 00:16:30.020
Dolores Albarracin: So.

196
00:16:30.020 --> 00:16:32.000
john bianculli: Have a bar within walking distance.

197
00:16:32.380 --> 00:16:38.249
Dolores Albarracin: Okay. So a lot of precautions and and taking care of yourself.

198
00:16:39.350 --> 00:16:42.780
john bianculli: Yeah, this is like my 3rd rehab stint.

199
00:16:42.810 --> 00:16:45.789
john bianculli: And what I was kind of doing was

200
00:16:46.080 --> 00:16:49.170
john bianculli: thinking of all of the what went wrongs

201
00:16:49.590 --> 00:16:52.880
john bianculli: and trying to put speed bumps to prevent those things from happening.

202
00:16:55.480 --> 00:17:03.230
Dolores Albarracin: Excellent. Well, congratulations on on all this planning. Yeah, in in only a week here.

203
00:17:03.720 --> 00:17:11.856
Dolores Albarracin: really setting these really necessary things. And and we'll go back to what's what's coming next. But I wanna make sure I ask

204
00:17:12.599 --> 00:17:22.819
Dolores Albarracin: everybody, Frank. I know you were looking for some type of group or or activity that would be

205
00:17:23.450 --> 00:17:27.980
Dolores Albarracin: interesting and safe. And all this tell us how that went.

206
00:17:27.980 --> 00:17:30.520
Frank: Yeah. So I I

207
00:17:30.750 --> 00:17:44.530
Frank: had signed up for a meet up previously. The app and but hadn't really done anything with it. So I signed up for it again, and I found a couple of groups.

208
00:17:45.042 --> 00:17:46.450
Frank: It doesn't look like

209
00:17:46.460 --> 00:17:50.490
Frank: it looks like they do things, but there's nothing there was nothing like coming up this week.

210
00:17:51.341 --> 00:17:53.810
Frank: But there's there's a group of

211
00:17:53.930 --> 00:17:57.069
Frank: queer millennials which is right up my alley.

212
00:17:57.695 --> 00:18:04.344
Frank: There's a i signed up for an LGBT book club, which is nice, and also a

213
00:18:06.100 --> 00:18:08.979
Frank: oh, a group for bloggers!

214
00:18:09.375 --> 00:18:12.220
Frank: Sober bloggers, which is kind of cool, so.

215
00:18:14.420 --> 00:18:26.249
Frank: In with 3 groups. Now, I'm just looking at their kind of upcoming activities. I've I've posted a couple of things on their like

216
00:18:26.310 --> 00:18:32.069
Frank: on their activities like chatted with a couple of people through the through the app.

217
00:18:32.956 --> 00:18:37.980
Frank: so I'm excited to to go to their next event.

218
00:18:38.300 --> 00:18:45.849
Dolores Albarracin: You were really above and beyond. Yes, looking for multiple activities of interest.

219
00:18:45.850 --> 00:18:49.079
Frank: Yeah, yeah, cause I kind of want to see. You know what works for me. If

220
00:18:49.180 --> 00:18:55.780
Frank: if one group, you know, if I'm not kind of feeling the vibe, or if it's just not you know I'm just not.

221
00:18:55.840 --> 00:19:01.969
Frank: you know, getting along with the folks that are there, I mean, for whatever reason it could fall through. So I wanted to have a couple of options.

222
00:19:02.700 --> 00:19:10.190
Dolores Albarracin: Excellent. Do people have comments on on these achievements? Frank John's.

223
00:19:11.720 --> 00:19:12.669
Morgan Potts: Good for you.

224
00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:13.950
Patricia Renaud: Yeah.

225
00:19:13.950 --> 00:19:14.770
Frank: Thank you.

226
00:19:14.770 --> 00:19:16.230
Patricia Renaud: Congratulations.

227
00:19:16.230 --> 00:19:19.120
john bianculli: Yeah, it's both about additional activities.

228
00:19:19.120 --> 00:19:24.333
Petra Teeter 237121: On top of. They're on top of their things. I'm just. I don't know. I just live.

229
00:19:24.640 --> 00:19:26.020
Dolores Albarracin: Oh, you did! You did.

230
00:19:26.020 --> 00:19:26.380
Petra Teeter 237121: It's so.

231
00:19:26.380 --> 00:19:29.949
Dolores Albarracin: You didn't wanna choose anything.

232
00:19:29.950 --> 00:19:32.689
Petra Teeter 237121: No, I'm just. I just think it's great.

233
00:19:32.870 --> 00:19:34.190
Petra Teeter 237121: It's good.

234
00:19:34.650 --> 00:19:37.860
Dolores Albarracin: They are motivated.

235
00:19:38.360 --> 00:19:39.300
Frank: What were you saying, John?

236
00:19:39.300 --> 00:19:43.010
john bianculli: There's an app called the Phoenix, where you can look up activities.

237
00:19:43.040 --> 00:19:46.839
john bianculli: The Phoenix put it on one as one word in Google play.

238
00:19:46.860 --> 00:19:48.800
john bianculli: And you put in your Zip code.

239
00:19:48.850 --> 00:19:52.699
john bianculli: and then it'll find groups that that do sober activities.

240
00:19:53.030 --> 00:19:53.660
Dolores Albarracin: Hmm.

241
00:19:53.660 --> 00:19:57.099
john bianculli: I'm in California, and it also works for Pennsylvania.

242
00:19:57.500 --> 00:20:15.673
Frank: Yeah, the the Phoenix is like a a specific like type of recovery. So it's in the same way that Aa is a group like Phoenix is a specific type of group. It's more for like sober I've looked at it, and

243
00:20:16.140 --> 00:20:18.945
Frank: they seemed a little bit out of my fitness range like

244
00:20:19.410 --> 00:20:24.050
Frank: the the events were like, you know, soccer and volleyball and

245
00:20:24.317 --> 00:20:25.859
Frank: that's not really stuff that I.

246
00:20:25.860 --> 00:20:27.190
john bianculli: Not in Pittsburgh.

247
00:20:27.190 --> 00:20:32.889
john bianculli: Oh, okay, that we have. We have one that does horror movies on Fridays.

248
00:20:32.890 --> 00:20:34.059
Frank: Oh, all right.

249
00:20:34.280 --> 00:20:36.570
Frank: Yeah. Here it was, all like, active.

250
00:20:36.570 --> 00:20:37.050
john bianculli: Love.

251
00:20:37.050 --> 00:20:40.332
Frank: A way above my fitness, level.

252
00:20:40.880 --> 00:20:42.560
Dolores Albarracin: I go to the horror movie.

253
00:20:42.560 --> 00:20:44.090
john bianculli: But don't forget, though, too.

254
00:20:44.380 --> 00:20:55.520
john bianculli: people are in recovery, and maybe I mean, I'm I'm starting to try to work out. I'm trying fitness. I mean, it is really good coping mechanism. If you're stressed to burn off the anger.

255
00:20:56.310 --> 00:20:56.730
Frank: Sure.

256
00:20:56.730 --> 00:20:58.520
john bianculli: I mean. I was joking in the chat

257
00:20:58.560 --> 00:21:01.240
john bianculli: I went bird watching instead of flipping people to bird.

258
00:21:02.460 --> 00:21:03.040
Frank: Yeah.

259
00:21:04.885 --> 00:21:05.470
Dolores Albarracin: Excellent!

260
00:21:05.470 --> 00:21:19.230
Petra Teeter 237121: It is something that has always helped me. Get through a very stressful and very frustrating life situations to the point where I was in in places where I just I I almost lost.

261
00:21:19.480 --> 00:21:26.019
Petra Teeter 237121: interested in in living and exercise and fresh air, will do it for me.

262
00:21:26.180 --> 00:21:29.130
Petra Teeter 237121: It could be reading a book for somebody.

263
00:21:29.559 --> 00:21:33.949
Petra Teeter 237121: If if I can go on a hike for I'll be.

264
00:21:33.990 --> 00:21:39.299
Petra Teeter 237121: It's like I used to call it my digestion of the day, if that makes any sense.

265
00:21:40.830 --> 00:21:48.030
Petra Teeter 237121: So it I I found it helpful to, I guess, think it through and find out what works

266
00:21:48.580 --> 00:21:55.560
Petra Teeter 237121: for me, because I know. There's, for example, my my husband. He'll be happy to just

267
00:21:55.590 --> 00:22:04.269
Petra Teeter 237121: sit in front of that TV and watch a movie that would drive me crazy. That does not work for me at all. It's just that. It's but it helps him.

268
00:22:04.510 --> 00:22:05.560
Frank: Right.

269
00:22:05.560 --> 00:22:05.970
Dolores Albarracin: Yeah.

270
00:22:05.970 --> 00:22:07.539
Petra Teeter 237121: We're all just very.

271
00:22:07.540 --> 00:22:07.900
Dolores Albarracin: Hey!

272
00:22:07.900 --> 00:22:11.960
Petra Teeter 237121: I could suggest something, and it would not do anything for anybody else.

273
00:22:11.960 --> 00:22:16.970
Dolores Albarracin: Yeah, very, very individual. Well, I hope you will choose something today.

274
00:22:17.020 --> 00:22:21.490
Dolores Albarracin: So, Morgan, you are, gonna send a card to your friend.

275
00:22:23.790 --> 00:22:28.569
Morgan Potts: Hey, guys, I don't know why it keeps muting me. But anyway, yeah, I'm

276
00:22:28.670 --> 00:22:39.600
Morgan Potts: I'll do it at some point not like now I'm I'm not a Christmas kind of person. I kind of dread it, so I'll do it just later. But I am gonna do it.

277
00:22:40.310 --> 00:22:47.730
Dolores Albarracin: I mean, it doesn't have to be a Christmas card, but it's not a card you saw was kind of a low commitment thing.

278
00:22:47.730 --> 00:22:57.160
Morgan Potts: Yes, yes, I mean I'm gonna send her Christmas cards. I feel like it would be a nice gesture. She loves Christmas and decorating for it and all that jazz. So I'll do that

279
00:22:57.477 --> 00:23:00.310
Morgan Potts: as we get closer. I mean, we haven't even hit Thanksgiving yet, so.

280
00:23:00.310 --> 00:23:05.509
Dolores Albarracin: Okay. So did you forget, or or you thought it wasn't a good idea, or what happened.

281
00:23:05.640 --> 00:23:14.715
Morgan Potts: Oh, no, it was just busy weekend. I went home for the weekend, and I just was like, I'm gonna I'm gonna send it when we, as we get closer to Christmas.

282
00:23:15.160 --> 00:23:20.659
Morgan Potts: I'm not gonna send it right now. I do have her address in my

283
00:23:20.820 --> 00:23:26.040
Morgan Potts: contacts still. So. But I'm gonna do it just not this week. I wasn't gonna be able to do it this weekend.

284
00:23:26.040 --> 00:23:26.380
Dolores Albarracin: Okay.

285
00:23:26.380 --> 00:23:32.289
Morgan Potts: I did take my niece Christmas shopping. That was the most Christmassy I have gotten so far.

286
00:23:34.300 --> 00:23:41.660
Petra Teeter 237121: Do it if you want to. That's just all I remember. I used to always be so nice and do all these things that I really didn't want to

287
00:23:42.100 --> 00:23:44.889
Petra Teeter 237121: only do it if you want to. That's all I'm saying.

288
00:23:45.860 --> 00:23:47.920
Morgan Potts: I'm sorry. What did you say, dear? I couldn't hear you.

289
00:23:48.640 --> 00:24:04.090
Frank: Yeah, I was just gonna say, yeah, I was gonna say that. you don't have to send it right now, I said, but maybe you know, writing the letter just to for your own benefit, like getting those thoughts down on paper. It helps me like when I you know, even if I

290
00:24:04.409 --> 00:24:17.580
Frank: like in recovery, I'd write a letter and and wouldn't send it. Let's say you have to send it, but it might help just to get your kind of thoughts down on paper. And that way you have time to to kind of edit and change things. If you don't think something's right.

291
00:24:18.060 --> 00:24:22.160
Morgan Potts: Yeah. Clear out the mental headspace, the cobweb, the cobwebs.

292
00:24:22.160 --> 00:24:27.890
Dolores Albarracin: I am excellent. Well, today I want to hello

293
00:24:27.890 --> 00:24:33.140
Dolores Albarracin: into our next important thing, which is to

294
00:24:33.170 --> 00:24:37.529
Dolores Albarracin: talk about our health and and something we would like to do

295
00:24:37.620 --> 00:24:42.400
Dolores Albarracin: for our health in the next week. This could be mental health, physical health.

296
00:24:42.600 --> 00:24:46.400
Dolores Albarracin: anything you you want. So yeah, just

297
00:24:48.190 --> 00:24:51.329
Dolores Albarracin: give it a minute and and think.

298
00:24:51.400 --> 00:24:56.050
Dolores Albarracin: what is it that I would like to do for my health in the next week

299
00:24:56.160 --> 00:25:00.389
Dolores Albarracin: could be something you're very clear about, or maybe you haven't gone to

300
00:25:00.590 --> 00:25:10.780
Dolores Albarracin: see a doctor anything, really, we all have to be monitoring and and taking care of ourselves in this way. So we think this is

301
00:25:11.160 --> 00:25:13.539
Dolores Albarracin: something that unites us all.

302
00:25:17.110 --> 00:25:18.651
Patricia Renaud: Thanks for oh, go ahead!

303
00:25:18.960 --> 00:25:20.480
Morgan Potts: No, no, no, you got no.

304
00:25:22.620 --> 00:25:27.770
Patricia Renaud: For me. I think it's weight loss. With the holidays coming up, I

305
00:25:27.980 --> 00:25:34.050
Patricia Renaud: went through menopause like 2 years ago, and the weight gain was

306
00:25:35.150 --> 00:25:48.480
Patricia Renaud: horrible. I don't want to say it was horrible, to put it plainly. I want to be in better shape, for you know, doing things with the grandkids. They're 5 and 6, and it's like.

307
00:25:48.980 --> 00:26:01.604
Patricia Renaud: now it's like Grammy. We want to get down on the floor, and we come down and play hot wheels and Legos with us, and it's like really hard. I can get down, but I can't get up. So

308
00:26:02.120 --> 00:26:11.089
Patricia Renaud: An exercise plan is what I'm planning on. I have a treadmill. So now that the weather here in Pennsylvania is

309
00:26:11.390 --> 00:26:15.959
Patricia Renaud: getting colder. I like to go outside and walk

310
00:26:16.310 --> 00:26:22.129
Patricia Renaud: but I'm planning like when the days are really bad. Sleet and snow and ice to, you know.

311
00:26:22.190 --> 00:26:26.269
Patricia Renaud: have some kind of regimen that I can stick to, and

312
00:26:26.340 --> 00:26:31.989
Patricia Renaud: my trouble is, motivation is I can do a week, and then

313
00:26:32.820 --> 00:26:37.710
Patricia Renaud: I either get bored or there's, you know, things happen, and.

314
00:26:38.720 --> 00:26:41.250
Dolores Albarracin: So how long have you not done this.

315
00:26:41.770 --> 00:26:42.829
Patricia Renaud: I'm sorry. What.

316
00:26:42.830 --> 00:26:45.429
Dolores Albarracin: How long has it been since you last did it.

317
00:26:46.280 --> 00:26:49.250
Patricia Renaud: I just started about 2 weeks ago.

318
00:26:49.260 --> 00:26:57.369
Patricia Renaud: So with work and all that, sometimes it's 12 h days. So.

319
00:26:57.670 --> 00:27:03.075
Patricia Renaud: coming home from a 12 h. Shift is kind of hard to want to jump on the treadmill. But

320
00:27:03.400 --> 00:27:06.580
Patricia Renaud: You know I need to, even if it's

321
00:27:07.620 --> 00:27:11.449
Patricia Renaud: 15 or 20 min at least, it's something better than nothing. But.

322
00:27:11.450 --> 00:27:15.569
Dolores Albarracin: And why? Why is it that you work 12 HA day.

323
00:27:16.300 --> 00:27:18.180
Patricia Renaud: That's my regular shift.

324
00:27:18.731 --> 00:27:30.099
Patricia Renaud: It's usually 8 h, but it can go if nobody shows up, for you know my spot. Then I have to stay mandatory 4 h over.

325
00:27:30.350 --> 00:27:32.329
Dolores Albarracin: And how many days a week.

326
00:27:33.225 --> 00:27:35.720
Patricia Renaud: I do. 5 days a week.

327
00:27:38.430 --> 00:27:41.300
Dolores Albarracin: So pretty! Rural! Yes.

328
00:27:41.300 --> 00:27:41.800
Patricia Renaud: New.

329
00:27:41.850 --> 00:27:50.739
Dolores Albarracin: When was the last time when you went on for maybe one week doing all the exercise that you like to be doing now?

330
00:27:52.410 --> 00:28:01.120
Patricia Renaud: I'd like to try. At least, you know. 3, rd I don't want to do a whole 7 days, because they say you should let yourself rest one day. So

331
00:28:01.210 --> 00:28:07.710
Patricia Renaud: at least 20 to 30 min of you know, vigorous walking or

332
00:28:08.040 --> 00:28:12.029
Patricia Renaud: outside, hiking or doing something physical like that.

333
00:28:12.300 --> 00:28:13.859
Dolores Albarracin: Have you ever done this.

334
00:28:14.060 --> 00:28:17.690
Patricia Renaud: Yeah, I was good for a few months, and then.

335
00:28:17.910 --> 00:28:20.130
Dolores Albarracin: When? When was this?

336
00:28:20.130 --> 00:28:22.060
Patricia Renaud: That was back in the summer.

337
00:28:22.060 --> 00:28:23.119
Dolores Albarracin: In the summer. Okay.

338
00:28:23.120 --> 00:28:23.955
Patricia Renaud: Yeah.

339
00:28:24.850 --> 00:28:31.620
Patricia Renaud: it was more outdoor work, you know, with the winter months. It's harder because I love the garden. So

340
00:28:31.640 --> 00:28:34.440
Patricia Renaud: the physical aspect of that digging and

341
00:28:34.630 --> 00:28:38.529
Patricia Renaud: planning things. You're up and down and bending and twisting, and

342
00:28:39.200 --> 00:28:44.770
Patricia Renaud: but now it's a little bit harder, with the days being shorter, and

343
00:28:45.100 --> 00:28:48.199
Patricia Renaud: the cold weather setting in so.

344
00:28:48.200 --> 00:28:56.110
Dolores Albarracin: And do you think if you were to add, let's say 3 days of 30 min, would that help with your wait long?

345
00:28:56.110 --> 00:29:01.420
Patricia Renaud: Yeah, with stress levels. And you know, just overall feeling better.

346
00:29:01.420 --> 00:29:02.630
Dolores Albarracin: Press.

347
00:29:02.900 --> 00:29:03.640
Patricia Renaud: Yeah.

348
00:29:07.190 --> 00:29:12.083
Patricia Renaud: and eating better. It's going to be hard this time of year. It always is

349
00:29:12.510 --> 00:29:16.710
Patricia Renaud: to try to eat, you know. Stay away from the junk food and the candy, but.

350
00:29:18.470 --> 00:29:19.120
Dolores Albarracin: But if you.

351
00:29:19.120 --> 00:29:24.479
john bianculli: Suggestion about the eating that I do, or I'm trying to start incorporating more.

352
00:29:25.020 --> 00:29:29.159
john bianculli: Pick your day off, get some containers.

353
00:29:29.250 --> 00:29:35.100
john bianculli: and cook like 5 healthy, like a big batch, so that you can divvy up 5 different lunches.

354
00:29:35.220 --> 00:29:37.060
john bianculli: and then you put them in the freezer.

355
00:29:37.240 --> 00:29:41.900
Patricia Renaud: Yeah, I do that for work. I do like meal prep. For I do like

356
00:29:41.960 --> 00:29:54.517
Patricia Renaud: a Saturday, if I can. Cook 2 or 3 different things. For my fiance, too. He takes it to work so a big batch of something and throw it in the freezer, and we're good to go

357
00:29:55.060 --> 00:30:01.980
Patricia Renaud: But now, with pies and cakes and pastries of all kinds, it's kind of hard

358
00:30:02.180 --> 00:30:08.329
Patricia Renaud: for the holidays, but willpower is something that I'm working on, you know.

359
00:30:08.760 --> 00:30:12.720
Patricia Renaud: to try and stay away from that. Have it in moderation, more or less.

360
00:30:14.030 --> 00:30:15.229
Dolores Albarracin: So we have some.

361
00:30:15.230 --> 00:30:17.040
john bianculli: Whenever I get a lunch.

362
00:30:17.850 --> 00:30:24.120
Dolores Albarracin: Sorry. Let me just somebody came in. I wanna make sure you know who this is.

363
00:30:27.640 --> 00:30:28.270
Dolores Albarracin: So.

364
00:30:28.270 --> 00:30:33.270
Feng Yi Chew: So. Yes. I asked Jennifer to join via phone because she was having difficulty.

365
00:30:33.270 --> 00:30:34.540
Dolores Albarracin: That's that's Jennifer.

366
00:30:35.390 --> 00:30:35.960
Dolores Albarracin: Okay?

367
00:30:36.460 --> 00:30:39.720
Dolores Albarracin: So yeah, go ahead, John, you were saying.

368
00:30:41.023 --> 00:30:44.020
john bianculli: During your lunch. Try to bring like sandwich wraps.

369
00:30:44.340 --> 00:30:46.519
john bianculli: and then you can walk while you're eating them.

370
00:30:47.110 --> 00:30:51.109
john bianculli: And if you only have an hour, it's kind of a way of getting exercise and eating at the same time.

371
00:30:52.500 --> 00:30:56.620
Dolores Albarracin: Yeah, that's a good idea. Do you? Do you get a lunch? Break? Pat.

372
00:30:56.840 --> 00:31:01.350
Patricia Renaud: Yeah, we get a half hour, and then there's 2 15 min breaks.

373
00:31:01.770 --> 00:31:13.520
Patricia Renaud: And then if there's overtime, we get an additional amount of time. Yeah, that's a good idea. When it was warmer I would go out and walk around the parking lot a few laps.

374
00:31:14.590 --> 00:31:19.369
Dolores Albarracin: And where could you walk right now during those breaks? Let's say.

375
00:31:21.120 --> 00:31:24.558
Patricia Renaud: With the days being shorter. It's kind of hard.

376
00:31:26.190 --> 00:31:29.889
Patricia Renaud: probably, you know, around the building or inside the building.

377
00:31:29.890 --> 00:31:31.019
Dolores Albarracin: By the building.

378
00:31:31.020 --> 00:31:33.600
Patricia Renaud: Yeah, we have the safety walkway. So we could do that.

379
00:31:33.600 --> 00:31:38.430
john bianculli: Sorry. Excuse me. Sorry something's been delivered.

380
00:31:40.350 --> 00:31:43.120
Morgan Potts: I don't know if you can. I'm sorry, I interrupted.

381
00:31:43.690 --> 00:31:45.210
Dolores Albarracin: No no go ahead. Morgan.

382
00:31:45.210 --> 00:31:55.239
Morgan Potts: I found on the Facebook Marketplace Yard sale thing, one of those, and I'm not sure what you do, Patricia, but one of those under desk treadmills.

383
00:31:56.950 --> 00:32:04.120
Morgan Potts: I found it, for, like 75 bucks or 50 bucks, and I don't know if that's an option for you. But I mean, like you said. It's it's something.

384
00:32:04.450 --> 00:32:04.840
Patricia Renaud: Yeah.

385
00:32:05.130 --> 00:32:11.700
Morgan Potts: I I need to use mine because I've I've got the same deal going on where I just like I have no motivation.

386
00:32:11.750 --> 00:32:15.729
Morgan Potts: and holidays are coming, and that's gonna be a struggle. So.

387
00:32:17.880 --> 00:32:18.550
Morgan Potts: Awesome.

388
00:32:18.550 --> 00:32:24.710
Petra Teeter 237121: Almost does that work. I'm just what I like. That idea.

389
00:32:24.900 --> 00:32:25.990
Morgan Potts: Yeah, they work. I mean.

390
00:32:25.990 --> 00:32:27.600
Petra Teeter 237121: Taking this time.

391
00:32:27.770 --> 00:32:29.569
Petra Teeter 237121: But so how did you?

392
00:32:30.470 --> 00:32:31.720
Petra Teeter 237121: Yeah, moving on it?

393
00:32:32.280 --> 00:32:35.050
Petra Teeter 237121: How do you do your work at the desk?

394
00:32:35.300 --> 00:32:36.160
Petra Teeter 237121: Yeah, okay.

395
00:32:36.160 --> 00:32:45.160
Morgan Potts: Yeah, you don't. You don't crank it up to where you can't talk. But you know, just doing anything while you're typing.

396
00:32:45.260 --> 00:32:49.640
Morgan Potts: It's the only negative is that it can be a little noisy. So

397
00:32:49.760 --> 00:32:53.449
Morgan Potts: you know, I'm not sure if you have office mates, or whatever. But.

398
00:32:54.870 --> 00:33:00.849
Dolores Albarracin: Back to this idea sort of you're thinking.

399
00:33:00.990 --> 00:33:08.290
Dolores Albarracin: Maybe one day a week you could work, you could walk and work during those breaks.

400
00:33:08.380 --> 00:33:17.059
Patricia Renaud: Yeah, I do factory type work. So I'm at a machine moving around and packaging things. So.

401
00:33:17.470 --> 00:33:21.100
Patricia Renaud: But I do have the treadmill at home. So.

402
00:33:22.550 --> 00:33:27.459
Patricia Renaud: but yeah, I'm definitely wanting to do it more.

403
00:33:28.140 --> 00:33:32.169
Dolores Albarracin: How about a place like a mall or- or

404
00:33:32.210 --> 00:33:39.110
Dolores Albarracin: church? One of those places and offers space to walk? That's none.

405
00:33:39.320 --> 00:33:44.159
Dolores Albarracin: Necessarily thinking about everything that you're thinking while at work.

406
00:33:46.600 --> 00:33:53.400
Patricia Renaud: We don't have any malls really close. I mean, they're within like a half hour drive. So

407
00:33:53.830 --> 00:33:58.070
Patricia Renaud: just going outside. I mean, we live in the country, so I can walk

408
00:33:58.210 --> 00:34:04.610
Patricia Renaud: through the fields, or you know, we're very a rural area. So.

409
00:34:04.610 --> 00:34:06.939
Dolores Albarracin: You were saying. It's kind of cold now.

410
00:34:06.940 --> 00:34:07.545
Patricia Renaud: Yeah.

411
00:34:08.159 --> 00:34:10.779
Dolores Albarracin: Yeah, and I get that. And

412
00:34:11.149 --> 00:34:17.689
Dolores Albarracin: so there, what are there any options? A school or or church, or.

413
00:34:18.100 --> 00:34:19.630
Patricia Renaud: Trying to think.

414
00:34:22.300 --> 00:34:28.429
Patricia Renaud: Not that I can think of. No, we're a pretty small area, so everything's few and far between.

415
00:34:30.170 --> 00:34:34.760
Dolores Albarracin: So the treadmill then seem the main option.

416
00:34:34.760 --> 00:34:35.429
Patricia Renaud: Yep.

417
00:34:35.860 --> 00:34:37.900
Dolores Albarracin: Unless it's like a gym or something.

418
00:34:37.900 --> 00:34:38.719
Patricia Renaud: Yeah.

419
00:34:39.690 --> 00:34:49.239
Patricia Renaud: or even I was thinking, maybe weight bands or something like that, you know, to change it up. So it's not so boring being, you know, on the treadmill, just doing that.

420
00:34:50.739 --> 00:34:55.840
Dolores Albarracin: Is there is anybody else wanting to work out here?

421
00:34:57.010 --> 00:35:00.829
Dolores Albarracin: And and maybe you could be on the phone on the treadmill.

422
00:35:01.350 --> 00:35:03.480
Dolores Albarracin: and it's a little bit less boring.

423
00:35:03.480 --> 00:35:04.897
Petra Teeter 237121: I'll do it.

424
00:35:07.150 --> 00:35:13.885
Patricia Renaud: I do the Pandora on my phone through. You know, one of those portable speaker things.

425
00:35:15.530 --> 00:35:21.079
Dolores Albarracin: So how many days are are you willing to to try to work out next week? Pat.

426
00:35:21.710 --> 00:35:27.740
Patricia Renaud: I'm gonna try at least, you know, for one, and then work my way up from there. Yeah.

427
00:35:27.740 --> 00:35:29.740
Dolores Albarracin: What day will that be.

428
00:35:30.931 --> 00:35:36.300
Patricia Renaud: I'm trying to think I should be off Friday.

429
00:35:38.090 --> 00:35:43.210
Patricia Renaud: So Friday, yeah, this coming Friday. So.

430
00:35:43.610 --> 00:35:44.350
Dolores Albarracin: Okay.

431
00:35:44.790 --> 00:35:49.200
Dolores Albarracin: Well, we'll be you know, wishing you.

432
00:35:50.070 --> 00:35:53.139
Patricia Renaud: Lot of good steps. Yeah, thank you.

433
00:35:53.290 --> 00:36:05.260
Dolores Albarracin: Well, I know Louis is here. Michelle also joined, but we are on the topic of health, and and something we would like to do for our own health, mental or physical.

434
00:36:05.370 --> 00:36:06.890
Patricia Renaud: By next week.

435
00:36:08.760 --> 00:36:14.310
Dolores Albarracin: And Lou, how did it go with calling your dad on that note?

436
00:36:18.598 --> 00:36:26.190
Lewis: Overall conversation went well didn't end how I expected, but the overall conversation and you talk.

437
00:36:26.850 --> 00:36:30.189
Dolores Albarracin: Okay, well, good for you. We'll we'll come back. But

438
00:36:30.380 --> 00:36:35.650
Dolores Albarracin: yeah, John, I think you wanted to jump onto the health issue right?

439
00:36:36.200 --> 00:36:39.969
john bianculli: Yeah, the health issue. I have a long term goal of quitting smoking.

440
00:36:40.520 --> 00:36:45.309
john bianculli: but due to the fact that I get cranky and irritable, I'm gonna wait till I get back to Pittsburgh to do that

441
00:36:45.370 --> 00:36:47.769
john bianculli: right now. I'm in a house with like 5 different people with

442
00:36:47.780 --> 00:36:49.720
john bianculli: that sharing room with 5 people.

443
00:36:49.970 --> 00:36:53.179
john bianculli: so I don't want to be cranky and irritable. So

444
00:36:53.420 --> 00:36:58.489
john bianculli: but short term, short term. What I've been doing. I'm trying to eat healthier

445
00:36:58.810 --> 00:37:03.000
john bianculli: like for lunch I made a piece of air, fried chicken and Brussels sprouts.

446
00:37:03.540 --> 00:37:04.280
Dolores Albarracin: Excellent.

447
00:37:04.558 --> 00:37:06.230
john bianculli: Teriyaki sauce, and a little sesame.

448
00:37:06.990 --> 00:37:07.850
Dolores Albarracin: At close.

449
00:37:07.850 --> 00:37:10.404
Petra Teeter 237121: I'll call over John. I like it.

450
00:37:10.770 --> 00:37:11.460
john bianculli: Yeah, thank, you.

451
00:37:11.460 --> 00:37:16.169
Dolores Albarracin: What's the plan for you, then, for the next week to stay.

452
00:37:16.170 --> 00:37:19.000
john bianculli: Continue to eat healthy. I'm gonna

453
00:37:19.240 --> 00:37:22.640
john bianculli: try to make a pact, not to eat anything that's takeout

454
00:37:23.040 --> 00:37:26.799
john bianculli: like. In other words, I want to cook everything, make it fresh from scratch.

455
00:37:26.960 --> 00:37:29.800
john bianculli: Keep it low, sodium, which will help my blood pressure.

456
00:37:32.500 --> 00:37:33.270
Dolores Albarracin: Excellent.

457
00:37:33.270 --> 00:37:35.920
john bianculli: Making it so that I can see my shoes again and lose weight.

458
00:37:36.290 --> 00:37:39.200
Dolores Albarracin: Have you been doing this pretty consistently.

459
00:37:39.610 --> 00:37:40.530
john bianculli: Yeah.

460
00:37:40.530 --> 00:37:48.479
Dolores Albarracin: Yes, so you're kind of doing this. And and is there something that you could add for next week to make it a little bit more difficult.

461
00:37:49.960 --> 00:37:55.709
john bianculli: And well, I mean I I already added exercise. I already added, eating better.

462
00:37:55.980 --> 00:37:56.490
Dolores Albarracin: Okay.

463
00:37:57.860 --> 00:38:00.480
john bianculli: Maybe making a call to my dad and my sister.

464
00:38:01.230 --> 00:38:01.590
Dolores Albarracin: Okay.

465
00:38:01.590 --> 00:38:03.380
john bianculli: Try to maybe patch it up with them.

466
00:38:04.490 --> 00:38:06.859
john bianculli: Is that a good adding on.

467
00:38:06.860 --> 00:38:14.800
Dolores Albarracin: That's especially related to next week. Yeah, if if would that make you feel better emotionally

468
00:38:15.910 --> 00:38:19.599
Dolores Albarracin: that were possible, or would it be more stressful? I don't know.

469
00:38:21.020 --> 00:38:21.930
john bianculli: Oh, did not.

470
00:38:21.930 --> 00:38:24.619
john bianculli: I'll try one of them. How about this? And I'll try my dad.

471
00:38:25.320 --> 00:38:28.039
john bianculli: We'll add my sister the following week. How did that sound.

472
00:38:29.690 --> 00:38:38.359
Dolores Albarracin: If that's what you'd like to do. That sounds great. Yeah. It seems like you're doing everything right for your health. At this point.

473
00:38:39.900 --> 00:38:41.629
john bianculli: Well, I'm trying to. I have a sponsor.

474
00:38:41.860 --> 00:38:46.230
john bianculli: so I'm trying to incorporate a lot of what he's telling me to do.

475
00:38:47.440 --> 00:38:50.360
john bianculli: I mean, at 1st the exercise I wasn't a big fan of.

476
00:38:50.400 --> 00:38:53.229
john bianculli: but now that I'm doing it, I feel better.

477
00:38:53.630 --> 00:38:57.680
john bianculli: So. Some of the things you tell me to do. I don't necessarily agree with, but I'm doing it.

478
00:38:58.090 --> 00:39:00.750
john bianculli: and maybe they'll become more healthy habits later.

479
00:39:01.790 --> 00:39:04.620
Dolores Albarracin: That sounds great comments from other others.

480
00:39:04.620 --> 00:39:10.000
Petra Teeter 237121: I was wondering, John is is that to me?

481
00:39:10.890 --> 00:39:12.589
Petra Teeter 237121: Sometimes it.

482
00:39:12.760 --> 00:39:22.669
Petra Teeter 237121: There's nothing the other person can do about this. If they're too close to me, and they say something. I'm going to be hurt in my feelings.

483
00:39:22.740 --> 00:39:26.690
Petra Teeter 237121: and some other person like maybe your sponsor

484
00:39:26.730 --> 00:39:31.969
Petra Teeter 237121: or somebody that's not closely connected to you. Right.

485
00:39:32.550 --> 00:39:34.170
john bianculli: Yeah, very nice.

486
00:39:34.170 --> 00:39:42.610
Petra Teeter 237121: In your face, and you're okay with it. That's how I've noticed in my life. I wonder if you were if that's if that feels like that to you.

487
00:39:43.610 --> 00:39:47.130
john bianculli: Well, I have a sponsor that doesn't sugarcoat, which is.

488
00:39:47.130 --> 00:39:48.490
Petra Teeter 237121: There you go. Yeah.

489
00:39:48.860 --> 00:39:52.810
john bianculli: I mean, it's there's good things and bad things. I'm focusing on the good.

490
00:39:53.460 --> 00:39:54.070
Petra Teeter 237121: Yeah.

491
00:39:56.140 --> 00:39:59.059
john bianculli: I mean negative feedback. You may like like hearing it.

492
00:39:59.390 --> 00:40:06.289
john bianculli: It may look like you ate a sour patch, kid, but sometimes you need that stuff. You can't be around a bunch of. Yes, people that agree with everything you say.

493
00:40:06.790 --> 00:40:11.579
Dolores Albarracin: Are you gonna keep this same sponsor once you go back or.

494
00:40:12.050 --> 00:40:13.910
john bianculli: I haven't talked that over with him.

495
00:40:14.464 --> 00:40:18.909
john bianculli: Whatever I said about him sponsoring me, I said. Temporary.

496
00:40:19.080 --> 00:40:21.870
john bianculli: So that's a discussion we're gonna have to have before I leave.

497
00:40:22.040 --> 00:40:27.120
john bianculli: hoping that I mean they're more than likely gonna tell me they want you to get a local one.

498
00:40:27.870 --> 00:40:31.639
john bianculli: but I may tell them, ask them, Hey, can we continue this as a backup?

499
00:40:31.990 --> 00:40:34.449
john bianculli: Okay? Or until I find a Pittsburgh one.

500
00:40:36.970 --> 00:40:42.230
Dolores Albarracin: So for your health. This could be a good goal for you to maybe bring that up.

501
00:40:44.290 --> 00:40:48.749
john bianculli: Yeah, the other thing I was gonna ask, too, though, how long this goes on for what 6 months.

502
00:40:49.870 --> 00:40:50.490
Dolores Albarracin: Yes.

503
00:40:51.790 --> 00:40:52.600
john bianculli: Yes.

504
00:40:52.960 --> 00:40:58.210
Dolores Albarracin: This this? Yes, but the groups meet 3 times and you stay online. Yes.

505
00:40:58.850 --> 00:41:02.149
john bianculli: Okay, very good. Yeah. So the online, this should kind of help me as well.

506
00:41:04.830 --> 00:41:05.650
Dolores Albarracin: Right?

507
00:41:07.140 --> 00:41:25.460
Dolores Albarracin: Okay? So yeah, we look forward to. I mean your continued progress with your health, John. It seems like you're doing lots of these things and and don't have a lot to add, maybe looking for for the sponsor situation, you know. Once once you go back.

508
00:41:26.250 --> 00:41:35.680
Dolores Albarracin: so I want to ask crystal crystal, where are you at with your health? Is is there something you'd like to achieve for you?

509
00:41:37.070 --> 00:41:39.010
Dolores Albarracin: Physical, mental.

510
00:41:44.540 --> 00:41:45.650
john bianculli: Are we still on me?

511
00:41:46.480 --> 00:41:49.050
Dolores Albarracin: Yeah, we moved to Bristol for the time being.

512
00:41:49.050 --> 00:41:50.090
Petra Teeter 237121: Muted. Yeah.

513
00:41:50.090 --> 00:41:51.090
john bianculli: Oh, okay.

514
00:41:55.870 --> 00:41:58.070
Dolores Albarracin: Sorry my hearing's a little off.

515
00:41:59.460 --> 00:42:01.168
Dolores Albarracin: Can you hear me now?

516
00:42:01.510 --> 00:42:02.180
Dolores Albarracin: I hear you.

517
00:42:02.180 --> 00:42:04.959
Krystal: Okay. I guess mainly just

518
00:42:05.710 --> 00:42:10.810
Krystal: making it through this week. Really, it's my birthday today, and it's always been pretty.

519
00:42:14.040 --> 00:42:17.830
Krystal: Pretty emotional week for me. Normally, I've

520
00:42:17.890 --> 00:42:20.210
Krystal: my birthdays aren't really something that

521
00:42:21.220 --> 00:42:25.579
Krystal: ever went good for me. It's always been a really horrible week, so.

522
00:42:25.580 --> 00:42:32.000
Dolores Albarracin: Why do you wanna tell us a bit about why this is.

523
00:42:34.250 --> 00:42:37.339
Krystal: I didn't have really a very good upbringing, and

524
00:42:37.570 --> 00:42:40.149
Krystal: my mom wasn't the greatest, and

525
00:42:40.250 --> 00:42:45.370
Krystal: our birthdays were, you know, are supposed to be about you. It's your birthday. But she was

526
00:42:45.510 --> 00:42:50.810
Krystal: very it's all about me. And if anything's about you, I'm gonna make you

527
00:42:51.120 --> 00:42:55.870
Krystal: regret even being there. So okay.

528
00:42:55.870 --> 00:42:58.969
Dolores Albarracin: When when is your birthday? Exactly.

529
00:42:59.217 --> 00:43:00.700
Krystal: Today today is actually my birthday.

530
00:43:00.700 --> 00:43:02.679
Dolores Albarracin: Okay. Well, happy birthday.

531
00:43:03.470 --> 00:43:04.260
Krystal: You.

532
00:43:04.700 --> 00:43:07.740
Dolores Albarracin: Happy birthday. So you know.

533
00:43:07.740 --> 00:43:13.020
Petra Teeter 237121: For spending your time with us on your birthday. How about that?

534
00:43:13.020 --> 00:43:13.450
Krystal: Yeah.

535
00:43:13.710 --> 00:43:19.240
Dolores Albarracin: What could you do to make this week a little bit happier.

536
00:43:20.950 --> 00:43:23.321
Krystal: Mainly just been staying away from people.

537
00:43:23.850 --> 00:43:28.420
Krystal: Okay, staying away from home.

538
00:43:28.590 --> 00:43:34.909
Krystal: Yeah. Yup, I don't talk to her anymore. So I I haven't spoke with her since like September, so.

539
00:43:35.260 --> 00:43:37.990
Dolores Albarracin: Okay, so you're not talking with your mom. But

540
00:43:38.780 --> 00:43:45.020
Dolores Albarracin: does does this work well, if not, not talking to anybody to make you happy or or.

541
00:43:45.556 --> 00:43:46.250
Krystal: I mean.

542
00:43:46.250 --> 00:43:47.180
Dolores Albarracin: Really only.

543
00:43:47.450 --> 00:43:49.399
Krystal: It does, but it doesn't

544
00:43:50.160 --> 00:43:56.249
Krystal: It cause I get real irritable and kind of like moody and emotional myself. So I try not to

545
00:43:56.550 --> 00:44:00.559
Krystal: lash out on people that don't deserve it. So I just

546
00:44:01.190 --> 00:44:04.550
Krystal: kind of just sticking to like my little arts and crafts projects and.

547
00:44:05.870 --> 00:44:10.419
Dolores Albarracin: Are you in in therapy, or some kind of treatment? Crystal.

548
00:44:10.892 --> 00:44:14.119
Krystal: I was for a long time, but I ended up.

549
00:44:14.809 --> 00:44:19.790
Krystal: I got into a really bad car accident in February, and then I just kind of went into like a

550
00:44:20.150 --> 00:44:26.250
Krystal: really dark place for a while, because I had to depend on everybody else to help me. And

551
00:44:26.690 --> 00:44:30.120
Krystal: so I just kinda I quit doing things I should have done, and.

552
00:44:30.840 --> 00:44:33.189
Dolores Albarracin: And how are you now? Physically.

553
00:44:33.558 --> 00:44:42.780
Krystal: I'm getting better I got like my anxiety is kind of through the roof sometimes, and like I, it's hard to be in vehicles

554
00:44:44.320 --> 00:44:50.371
Krystal: and then, like, I've just started going back to therapy. My, it'll be like my second

555
00:44:51.610 --> 00:44:55.580
Krystal: My second session will be tomorrow, actually. So.

556
00:44:57.470 --> 00:45:05.880
Dolores Albarracin: Okay. So a lot a lot going on. What are? What are the physical consequences of the accident? Crystal.

557
00:45:06.518 --> 00:45:11.681
Krystal: I I broke my collarbone really bad, so I had to have a surgery

558
00:45:12.400 --> 00:45:15.400
Krystal: And then I would but

559
00:45:16.030 --> 00:45:22.150
Krystal: shattered one of the vertebrae in my neck, and so it's like hard to turn certain ways. And

560
00:45:23.345 --> 00:45:31.410
Krystal: I broke the L. 4 down at the bottom. It's like right by your sciatic nerve. And it

561
00:45:31.450 --> 00:45:35.570
Krystal: I've had some issues with that. I have to do physical therapy twice a week, and.

562
00:45:37.810 --> 00:45:39.240
Dolores Albarracin: So? Is there something.

563
00:45:39.240 --> 00:45:39.873
Krystal: Getting there.

564
00:45:40.190 --> 00:45:44.210
Dolores Albarracin: Doing. Yeah, a very long and very painful list.

565
00:45:44.420 --> 00:45:44.940
Krystal: Yeah.

566
00:45:44.940 --> 00:45:54.790
Dolores Albarracin: Is there something that you should be doing for for all these fractures? Let's say that you're not doing that could make you a little bit healthier.

567
00:45:55.877 --> 00:46:00.080
Krystal: Probably actually going to the physical therapy, because I've

568
00:46:00.290 --> 00:46:13.490
Krystal: I've been going like once a week, and I'm supposed to be going like 2 to 3, depending on what they say, and I just kinda go the 1st day of the week, and then I'm in pain. So then I quit going, and I just need to stick it out and follow through.

569
00:46:13.850 --> 00:46:23.109
Dolores Albarracin: I wanna? Ask for the group's input on this. What? What are people's thoughts about this situation? Potentially, if you know

570
00:46:23.200 --> 00:46:31.580
Dolores Albarracin: physical therapy and and going perhaps more frequently, but dealing with pain.

571
00:46:31.990 --> 00:46:37.260
Dolores Albarracin: Do others have experiences or thoughts, comments, questions for crystal.

572
00:46:37.580 --> 00:46:43.422
Frank: Yeah, I mean, the I can just contribute to that, because I'm currently in a physical therapy right now.

573
00:46:44.310 --> 00:46:48.789
Frank: and it's a pain in the ass to go, and it's not something that I enjoy.

574
00:46:49.557 --> 00:46:57.899
Frank: and I should be doing the physical therapy exercise at home, too, but I don't do them, but I do go twice a week, and

575
00:46:57.940 --> 00:46:59.360
Frank: just the

576
00:46:59.460 --> 00:47:22.509
Frank: they really know their their stuff. You know what I mean, and a lot of the stuff that they teach you how to do really does help like. So you don't have to be as dependent on like pain medications or just medications in general, so it's worth giving it a shot. I know it sucks. We call Pt. Pain and torture, but it really does. It really does help.

577
00:47:22.510 --> 00:47:23.070
Krystal: Okay.

578
00:47:24.310 --> 00:47:27.860
john bianculli: I'm in agreement. If you hate your therapist, they're doing a good job.

579
00:47:28.340 --> 00:47:31.309
john bianculli: That means they're pushing you beyond your comfort level.

580
00:47:31.780 --> 00:47:32.460
Krystal: Yeah.

581
00:47:33.090 --> 00:47:36.310
Dolores Albarracin: And crystal. You have a son, right? You said.

582
00:47:36.675 --> 00:47:37.040
Krystal: Daughter!

583
00:47:37.040 --> 00:47:39.950
Dolores Albarracin: Daughter, how old is your daughter?

584
00:47:40.410 --> 00:47:42.000
Krystal: Oh, she's 13.

585
00:47:42.220 --> 00:47:43.160
Dolores Albarracin: 13.

586
00:47:44.080 --> 00:47:47.109
Dolores Albarracin: Is she a motivation for you to get better.

587
00:47:47.440 --> 00:47:54.560
Krystal: Yeah, yeah, absolutely. It's it's like, if it wasn't for her, I probably would have just gave up already.

588
00:47:57.460 --> 00:48:06.859
Petra Teeter 237121: I wanted to say something. If it's okay about the physical therapy I've mentioned before, but I don't know if I have but for about

589
00:48:07.910 --> 00:48:16.860
Petra Teeter 237121: trying to do the math. For about 18 years I've had intense chronic pain, and I just

590
00:48:17.110 --> 00:48:21.050
Petra Teeter 237121: eventually learned to live with it and

591
00:48:21.300 --> 00:48:30.560
Petra Teeter 237121: not be as grumpy because that makes me very angry. It's literally if I could just have a Punch ball there, just Punch, it would help me.

592
00:48:31.201 --> 00:48:37.929
Petra Teeter 237121: Physical therapy. I've done it 3 times. It's they're painful for the

593
00:48:38.010 --> 00:48:49.220
Petra Teeter 237121: for your finances. At least my co-payment was pretty high. And after the 3rd

594
00:48:49.580 --> 00:48:53.160
Petra Teeter 237121: I'm not saying it didn't help, but

595
00:48:53.410 --> 00:48:57.450
Petra Teeter 237121: I need the physical therapy when that pain really hits.

596
00:48:58.480 --> 00:49:02.869
Petra Teeter 237121: It's like I had to schedule it 3 times a week. That's not helpful.

597
00:49:03.270 --> 00:49:05.753
Petra Teeter 237121: I need it when it when I need it.

598
00:49:06.160 --> 00:49:07.030
Petra Teeter 237121: And

599
00:49:07.270 --> 00:49:16.939
Petra Teeter 237121: so what I learned after the 3 times I just I ended up saying, No, for one reason. I just learned what worked for me.

600
00:49:17.404 --> 00:49:25.470
Petra Teeter 237121: So I took that information and all the the you know, the the physical help I was given by those therapists.

601
00:49:25.600 --> 00:49:35.079
Petra Teeter 237121: and and just used it for myself at home, and tried to recreate it. So now I can do it when I need it when that pain really hits.

602
00:49:35.300 --> 00:49:44.390
Petra Teeter 237121: And I also looked online just to find some more written support of what I can do with it, or maybe add on, or

603
00:49:45.190 --> 00:49:50.149
Petra Teeter 237121: what helps me, but also put my own thing in.

604
00:49:50.320 --> 00:49:53.670
Dolores Albarracin: Are you making Crystal a recommendation?

605
00:49:55.130 --> 00:49:58.780
Dolores Albarracin: Do you have advice for crystal plan? What? What?

606
00:49:59.620 --> 00:50:01.489
Dolores Albarracin: Oh, my advice would be.

607
00:50:01.530 --> 00:50:28.529
Petra Teeter 237121: And again, that's just what worked for me personally, but just not to get too frustrated with those therapy sessions and just kind of go through them and take from them what you can, and then remember what worked for you and try to do this at home. Your pain is from an accident, so I don't know if you can. My pain is not from an accident. It's just there.

608
00:50:29.700 --> 00:50:30.540
Petra Teeter 237121: So

609
00:50:31.690 --> 00:50:36.710
Petra Teeter 237121: I don't know if if it's safe for you, or do you have to be worried about

610
00:50:37.000 --> 00:50:47.490
Petra Teeter 237121: breaking your bones? I'm not. I'm not a doctor, obviously for me. There's nothing physically broken in me.

611
00:50:47.530 --> 00:51:02.410
Petra Teeter 237121: It's just that pain. And and so certain exercises or movements, or just holding myself a certain way, will will help me get over that pain. And so that's why I can do it

612
00:51:02.840 --> 00:51:04.080
Petra Teeter 237121: at home.

613
00:51:04.580 --> 00:51:09.000
Petra Teeter 237121: I'm not sure what your therapy would look like, but I guess my

614
00:51:09.340 --> 00:51:18.369
Petra Teeter 237121: suggestion would be if that works for you to just take from it what you can, and try it on your own, so

615
00:51:18.510 --> 00:51:24.219
Petra Teeter 237121: you can do it at your own convenience, or in your own house, or wherever you want to do it.

616
00:51:26.050 --> 00:51:27.919
Petra Teeter 237121: So where? Where are you? At.

617
00:51:28.550 --> 00:51:35.870
Dolores Albarracin: Well with with this idea of of going more frequently.

618
00:51:37.500 --> 00:51:37.890
Lewis: Oh!

619
00:51:37.890 --> 00:51:38.630
Krystal: I need you.

620
00:51:38.630 --> 00:51:38.960
Lewis: Totally.

621
00:51:38.960 --> 00:51:45.839
Krystal: It just I guess the whole getting in the car thing kind of deters me a little bit.

622
00:51:49.510 --> 00:51:50.270
Dolores Albarracin: Okay.

623
00:51:50.460 --> 00:51:52.959
Dolores Albarracin: So, Lou, you are saying something.

624
00:51:54.070 --> 00:52:00.950
Lewis: Oh, no! I was just going to add in that you have to think about the future, how you, how your body will feel in the future.

625
00:52:00.990 --> 00:52:07.469
Lewis: so as many as many of those physical therapy consultations and and and

626
00:52:07.600 --> 00:52:13.349
Lewis: appointments you can take. Take them. I was struck by a car in November of 2021,

627
00:52:13.490 --> 00:52:20.769
Lewis: and my copay similar to what Petra was saying. My copay was rather expensive, and I kind of

628
00:52:20.960 --> 00:52:23.960
Lewis: fell off from doing it as frequently as I should have

629
00:52:24.080 --> 00:52:28.040
Lewis: to. Where now I would have to make a full payment in order to get

630
00:52:28.080 --> 00:52:34.539
Lewis: physical therapy, and there'll be times when my body will hurt, and then I'll realize oh, it's from my surgery.

631
00:52:34.820 --> 00:52:39.410
Lewis: So you want to take as much advantage as you can stay positive in it

632
00:52:39.420 --> 00:52:45.420
Lewis: and look towards the future, that you're going to feel better and and actually be feel mentally better about it.

633
00:52:46.060 --> 00:52:46.660
Krystal: Right.

634
00:52:47.380 --> 00:52:50.869
Dolores Albarracin: Crystal. I see you and and

635
00:52:51.020 --> 00:52:58.270
Dolores Albarracin: you don't seem like you. You want to really move forward. Yeah, like, I.

636
00:52:58.790 --> 00:52:59.669
Krystal: Say that one more time.

637
00:52:59.670 --> 00:53:05.500
Dolores Albarracin: I look on your face, and and you seem very sad and and very hopeless.

638
00:53:06.660 --> 00:53:08.450
Krystal: Yeah, I'm I'm just kind of like

639
00:53:08.870 --> 00:53:10.609
Krystal: in a lot of pain today. It's

640
00:53:10.630 --> 00:53:15.720
Krystal: I'm also it's rainy and nasty here. And so.

641
00:53:16.620 --> 00:53:18.989
Petra Teeter 237121: I will do for the pain. I know

642
00:53:19.000 --> 00:53:21.040
Petra Teeter 237121: I don't know why it just does.

643
00:53:21.040 --> 00:53:29.180
Dolores Albarracin: Doable goal be maybe bringing up the issue of Pt. When with your therapist, not the Pt.

644
00:53:29.620 --> 00:53:33.350
Dolores Albarracin: Therapist, but the other, for you know your feelings.

645
00:53:33.720 --> 00:53:34.440
Krystal: Yeah.

646
00:53:34.920 --> 00:53:35.280
Dolores Albarracin: Have you?

647
00:53:35.280 --> 00:53:36.140
Krystal: It's.

648
00:53:36.140 --> 00:53:36.520
Dolores Albarracin: Have you?

649
00:53:36.520 --> 00:53:48.560
Krystal: I've been doing the online therapy. So it's a little bit easier it used to be. I'd have to drive to him or get somebody to drive me, but he made it to where I can do the online like, talk like how we're doing on the Zoom Meeting. So it.

650
00:53:48.560 --> 00:53:55.919
Dolores Albarracin: Okay, okay, so wouldn't make sense for you to to discuss this by next week.

651
00:53:57.600 --> 00:54:00.015
Krystal: That'd be the smart thing to do.

652
00:54:00.810 --> 00:54:04.720
Dolores Albarracin: Yeah, because it it seems very, very difficult. Yeah.

653
00:54:05.040 --> 00:54:05.750
Krystal: Yeah.

654
00:54:06.770 --> 00:54:11.999
Dolores Albarracin: Really, we don't want to push you to to, you know. Do what you

655
00:54:12.550 --> 00:54:16.989
Dolores Albarracin: don't want to do. But at the same time I see? I said, Wow, this

656
00:54:17.920 --> 00:54:22.609
Dolores Albarracin: this looks really rough. Yeah. And I don't. Yeah.

657
00:54:22.630 --> 00:54:33.480
Dolores Albarracin: Know what the solution is. Are you in touch with anybody? I mean, you mentioned everybody. You don't want to see. But is there somebody who could actually

658
00:54:33.550 --> 00:54:35.269
Dolores Albarracin: make you feel better.

659
00:54:36.562 --> 00:54:40.190
Krystal: Yeah, my my boyfriend and my daughter. They they help a lot.

660
00:54:40.630 --> 00:54:43.700
Dolores Albarracin: Okay, that's good.

661
00:54:44.980 --> 00:54:51.110
Dolores Albarracin: Great! Well, how how about others? Morgan.

662
00:54:51.110 --> 00:54:51.965
Morgan Potts: Oh,

663
00:54:53.610 --> 00:54:55.778
Morgan Potts: I I need to.

664
00:54:56.840 --> 00:54:58.900
Krystal: There it is! Oh, I need I.

665
00:54:58.900 --> 00:55:05.360
Morgan Potts: Need to get back into working out, I mean. And and my.

666
00:55:05.390 --> 00:55:10.250
Morgan Potts: I was listening to what Patricia was saying, and I'm like, yep, I feel that. Yep.

667
00:55:10.710 --> 00:55:17.260
Dolores Albarracin: I feel that, too. And how long has it been? How long, without working out for you.

668
00:55:18.370 --> 00:55:23.970
Morgan Potts: Oh, oh, gosh! I think I got really slack around like June or July.

669
00:55:25.840 --> 00:55:30.079
Morgan Potts: Yeah, I think July sounds more more accurate. And

670
00:55:30.640 --> 00:55:32.800
Morgan Potts: right now, you know, it's just

671
00:55:33.350 --> 00:55:39.370
Morgan Potts: when you get home. I mean, I just don't have any inner, any energy, and I don't, and I know that

672
00:55:40.340 --> 00:55:46.797
Morgan Potts: exercising will give you energy. But if you don't have the energy to exercise, you know it's a vicious circle.

673
00:55:48.630 --> 00:55:50.239
Morgan Potts: but that is.

674
00:55:50.550 --> 00:56:09.860
Morgan Potts: I need to start just by doing like just 10 min a day, then 20, then 30, just slowly working it up because the idea of spending an hour in a gym right now is just like way, mentally, just too much. So I need to just do it incrementally and work myself back to what I was doing.

675
00:56:10.190 --> 00:56:14.709
Morgan Potts: So it's not gonna be pleasant. It's going to suck, but I need to do it.

676
00:56:14.710 --> 00:56:19.839
Dolores Albarracin: 10 min, Morgan, of walking, or what are you thinking.

677
00:56:20.352 --> 00:56:26.280
Morgan Potts: I mean, just do the elliptical for 10 min, and then make it 20, and you know 30, and you know.

678
00:56:26.280 --> 00:56:30.759
Dolores Albarracin: Think of 10, not not even not 20, just 10.

679
00:56:31.060 --> 00:56:33.269
Dolores Albarracin: The Olympics at home.

680
00:56:33.340 --> 00:56:35.240
Dolores Albarracin: Do you know people or.

681
00:56:35.240 --> 00:56:39.030
Morgan Potts: We? We have a gym. An employee. Gym.

682
00:56:39.120 --> 00:56:40.290
Dolores Albarracin: Okay.

683
00:56:40.290 --> 00:56:48.659
Dolores Albarracin: Oh, that's convenient. So 10 min, how many days a week could you do that? That would be realistic.

684
00:56:48.900 --> 00:56:53.009
Morgan Potts: Realist realistically, because I need to be here. We'll say 3.

685
00:56:53.960 --> 00:56:56.819
Dolores Albarracin: 3. That's a lot, maybe 2.

686
00:56:57.780 --> 00:57:02.759
Morgan Potts: Okay. 2. I like 2, two's better than 3, because I don't want to do 3. But yeah, two's good.

687
00:57:02.760 --> 00:57:05.060
Dolores Albarracin: What days would that be.

688
00:57:06.144 --> 00:57:09.780
Morgan Potts: Mondays are good days to get started, and

689
00:57:09.790 --> 00:57:16.020
Morgan Potts: Wednesdays ideally. I would like to do Monday through Thursday, but like I used to do

690
00:57:16.020 --> 00:57:16.749
Morgan Potts: when I was just.

691
00:57:16.750 --> 00:57:20.200
Dolores Albarracin: But you're not there yet. You're.

692
00:57:20.200 --> 00:57:25.054
Morgan Potts: I know, but we'll we'll say, like Monday, Wednesday,

693
00:57:26.250 --> 00:57:27.739
Dolores Albarracin: The Olympics are.

694
00:57:27.830 --> 00:57:32.239
Dolores Albarracin: Yeah. Do you need to take special clothes to work or or.

695
00:57:32.240 --> 00:57:38.270
Morgan Potts: Oh, yeah, I used to pack a gym bag and just change right there, so I could just go to the employee. Gym.

696
00:57:38.840 --> 00:57:39.469
Dolores Albarracin: Nice to meet you.

697
00:57:39.470 --> 00:57:40.909
Morgan Potts: I just need to do it.

698
00:57:44.490 --> 00:57:46.559
Dolores Albarracin: But Pat reminded you.

699
00:57:47.780 --> 00:57:51.050
Morgan Potts: It was kind of like, all right.

700
00:57:51.480 --> 00:58:04.030
Morgan Potts: you got this far. Just put the clothes on, just put the clothes on, and then just go and just do 10 min. And then once I get back into it, it'll be like, Okay, that wasn't so bad. I can do 15. I want to do 15

701
00:58:04.450 --> 00:58:08.950
Morgan Potts: so just getting in there, that would be my goal. To walk through the door.

702
00:58:09.410 --> 00:58:10.080
Dolores Albarracin: As well.

703
00:58:10.080 --> 00:58:10.979
Morgan Potts: The door

704
00:58:11.690 --> 00:58:23.939
Morgan Potts: when when I think about it, having to take extra clothes, would it be possible to maybe wear something that you can also wear and and do your elliptical in minutes or no.

705
00:58:23.940 --> 00:58:36.170
Morgan Potts: probably not with my job. No, but it's okay. I mean, it's just. It's just some clothes I can just throw some clothes in a bag. It's the clothes aren't the problem. It's the walking through the door and committing to doing it. That's the problem.

706
00:58:36.520 --> 00:58:37.130
Patricia Renaud: Yep.

707
00:58:37.870 --> 00:58:43.450
Dolores Albarracin: Is the main problem, and you're just tired sick of work.

708
00:58:43.450 --> 00:58:46.519
Morgan Potts: Cold, and it's dark, and I want to go home. Yeah.

709
00:58:47.260 --> 00:58:49.840
Dolores Albarracin: But he's start a little bit earlier, maybe.

710
00:58:50.460 --> 00:58:51.180
Morgan Potts: Ma'am.

711
00:58:51.630 --> 00:58:53.870
Dolores Albarracin: Could you start a little bit earlier.

712
00:58:54.290 --> 00:58:57.290
Morgan Potts: Yeah, maybe maybe. Or I could

713
00:58:57.750 --> 00:59:11.189
Morgan Potts: trying to go on my lunch break. It won't work. But I mean I can walk straight there right after work, and not even go near the parking lot. Just go straight there. And if I could just get through the doors, y'all, I'll be okay.

714
00:59:12.300 --> 00:59:13.883
Morgan Potts: That's that's the hard part.

715
00:59:14.200 --> 00:59:14.560
Dolores Albarracin: Yeah.

716
00:59:15.000 --> 00:59:19.249
Morgan Potts: A lot of difficulties. Yeah, I mean.

717
00:59:19.250 --> 00:59:24.379
Morgan Potts: it's the willpower just to do it and not go home and lay on the couch and watch crappy TV.

718
00:59:25.810 --> 00:59:33.280
Dolores Albarracin: Yeah, what do people think? What could she do to sort of have the strength to go through it?

719
00:59:33.280 --> 00:59:36.290
Frank: Well, do you? Do you have? Do you have more energy in the morning?

720
00:59:37.050 --> 00:59:43.919
Morgan Potts: No, no, I'm more like an afternoon. No, I'm more like an afternoon person. But it.

721
00:59:43.950 --> 00:59:48.730
Morgan Potts: my boss is just really he's strict, he is so.

722
00:59:49.580 --> 00:59:55.368
Morgan Potts: and doing it at lunch. God forbid! If I'm a little bit late I get the wrath. So

723
00:59:55.690 --> 00:59:56.040
Frank: Nice.

724
00:59:56.390 --> 00:59:56.989
Morgan Potts: But I mean.

725
00:59:57.359 --> 01:00:02.169
Frank: Not a morning person either, so I wouldn't work work out at morning.

726
01:00:02.540 --> 01:00:12.860
Morgan Potts: No, but I mean just doing it right after work. It's it's always been when I did it, anyway, so it might as well just keep with tradition in a way.

727
01:00:13.620 --> 01:00:17.550
Morgan Potts: so I'll I'll I just need to do it. So.

728
01:00:18.090 --> 01:00:21.200
Frank: Or maybe find somebody at work that wants to do it with you. I don't know.

729
01:00:21.200 --> 01:00:25.729
Morgan Potts: Yeah. And I need to get back to wearing my fitbit because I think it will.

730
01:00:25.770 --> 01:00:26.290
Morgan Potts: The

731
01:00:26.290 --> 01:00:34.380
Morgan Potts: numbers don't lie, and it will show me like how much you're not moving in a day, and I think that will probably be

732
01:00:34.590 --> 01:00:38.760
Morgan Potts: motivating as well to be like, oh, wow! Okay, yeah.

733
01:00:39.750 --> 01:00:43.870
Dolores Albarracin: So, and again, what made you stop, Morgan?

734
01:00:47.780 --> 01:00:48.590
Morgan Potts: I don't know.

735
01:00:49.960 --> 01:00:50.900
Morgan Potts: I just

736
01:00:51.330 --> 01:00:56.570
Morgan Potts: got comfortable and used to saying, I don't want to do it today. I'll do it tomorrow.

737
01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:58.389
Morgan Potts: I'll do it tomorrow.

738
01:00:59.170 --> 01:01:00.989
Morgan Potts: And what difference does it make, anyway?

739
01:01:01.330 --> 01:01:04.340
Morgan Potts: Which is not the best mentality? I understand.

740
01:01:04.730 --> 01:01:09.990
Petra Teeter 237121: Does it make you feel good, though, when you do it like physically, feel and make.

741
01:01:09.990 --> 01:01:14.200
Morgan Potts: Yes, yes, that's why I'm like

742
01:01:14.800 --> 01:01:20.789
Morgan Potts: you're you're defeating the purpose here, Morgan, by not going. You want to feel better about yourselves, and that's how you do it.

743
01:01:20.790 --> 01:01:21.360
Petra Teeter 237121: Wow!

744
01:01:21.360 --> 01:01:22.070
Morgan Potts: So.

745
01:01:22.780 --> 01:01:23.370
Petra Teeter 237121: Yeah.

746
01:01:23.520 --> 01:01:27.480
Morgan Potts: You guys will be my limited innovation to get my butt through the door.

747
01:01:27.480 --> 01:01:33.959
Dolores Albarracin: Well here, waiting to know yeah, when what happened Thursday and Monday.

748
01:01:33.960 --> 01:01:36.260
Morgan Potts: Yes, I will go. I will go!

749
01:01:36.470 --> 01:01:40.369
Dolores Albarracin: Okay? And you can, yeah, check in with pat or.

750
01:01:40.370 --> 01:01:45.060
Patricia Renaud: Yeah, I'm thinking of starting like a journal, too.

751
01:01:46.470 --> 01:01:50.709
Patricia Renaud: you know, writing down what I did, and when I did it, and.

752
01:01:51.640 --> 01:01:52.840
Morgan Potts: I used to do that.

753
01:01:52.930 --> 01:01:54.040
Patricia Renaud: Yeah, it was helpful.

754
01:01:55.070 --> 01:02:00.270
Dolores Albarracin: Do you do an electronic journal or or paper journal? How how.

755
01:02:00.270 --> 01:02:06.569
Patricia Renaud: Yeah, I can just jot things down and reminders put it on the fridge

756
01:02:07.690 --> 01:02:12.490
Patricia Renaud: instead of reaching for that snack. Get on the treadmill.

757
01:02:15.090 --> 01:02:22.749
Dolores Albarracin: Okay, so, Lou, how about you and your health?

758
01:02:24.892 --> 01:02:29.320
Lewis: My health has been slacking, as of late. I was saying.

759
01:02:29.570 --> 01:02:31.903
Lewis: The last 2, 3 years.

760
01:02:32.640 --> 01:02:40.380
Lewis: trying to secure Medicaid has been an issue. I'm sure I'm in their system, but they never sent me a card.

761
01:02:41.730 --> 01:02:46.000
Lewis: I pretty much haven't gone on just the overall

762
01:02:46.617 --> 01:02:50.890
Lewis: you know. Physical checkup or anything in over a year.

763
01:02:50.980 --> 01:02:55.729
Lewis: So I think for me, it's just, you know, catching up all of that on all of that stuff, and then.

764
01:02:56.282 --> 01:03:09.690
Lewis: finding finding out the information for the the free clinics for each of those particular health concerns a dentist to, you know, somebody for respiratory, somebody for digestive health.

765
01:03:09.700 --> 01:03:12.170
Lewis: So I have the resources to just

766
01:03:12.240 --> 01:03:15.760
Lewis: similar to what Morgan was saying. It's like you. You kind of

767
01:03:15.960 --> 01:03:22.149
Lewis: get busy in your life and kind of slack off on the stuff that you. You know that you really need to get done.

768
01:03:23.830 --> 01:03:28.580
Dolores Albarracin: So you were saying you have Medicaid, but you don't have the card.

769
01:03:29.190 --> 01:03:32.339
Lewis: Yeah, so it kind of made me unsure. And then that's.

770
01:03:32.340 --> 01:03:37.280
Dolores Albarracin: More about this. How? How is this? This card obtained.

771
01:03:38.636 --> 01:03:48.650
Lewis: You go through the online service and basically sign up for it. And then they qualify. You and I went through the whole process, and then I even received something in the mail, saying, You're signed up, and then

772
01:03:48.720 --> 01:03:56.209
Lewis: never received a card, so I kind of asked my dad about it when that was happening was pretty much right after my accident.

773
01:03:56.722 --> 01:04:01.660
Lewis: And the general consensus was that you have it? You just have to.

774
01:04:01.690 --> 01:04:05.069
Lewis: They go into the places, and they pull up the information, and that kind of

775
01:04:05.150 --> 01:04:10.839
Lewis: puts me off, and and not feeling secure in knowing that I have some type of coverage.

776
01:04:11.040 --> 01:04:17.109
Lewis: And then from there a lot of times, if it's something to where it's multiple steps in my life that I kind of

777
01:04:17.180 --> 01:04:23.249
Lewis: put it to the side and and try not to stress as much about it. But it is something that I need to get corrected for sure.

778
01:04:24.700 --> 01:04:35.860
Dolores Albarracin: So is, is there an actual physical card? Or or could this card be be downloaded online? Or maybe.

779
01:04:35.860 --> 01:04:36.870
Lewis: I'm not sure.

780
01:04:36.870 --> 01:04:39.639
Dolores Albarracin: And see if that goes through.

781
01:04:43.280 --> 01:04:49.339
Lewis: I really wasn't sure, and then, not being sure, and then not getting the information from people that I know.

782
01:04:49.940 --> 01:04:52.930
Lewis: you know would probably have the information. It kind of just.

783
01:04:52.970 --> 01:05:00.209
Lewis: you know. Put that little bit of if I'm not securely positive that I have it going in there

784
01:05:00.320 --> 01:05:04.170
Lewis: that they come out and ask me for money for me to do it. I just kind of

785
01:05:04.500 --> 01:05:10.809
Lewis: put it to the side, and then I had a friend that's gone through our our county government as far as

786
01:05:10.850 --> 01:05:13.370
Lewis: the free clinic, the different stuff.

787
01:05:13.560 --> 01:05:17.800
Lewis: So he, he recently gave me that information in the last 2 months, and

788
01:05:18.190 --> 01:05:26.340
Lewis: you know I end up getting busy and and putting it in the back of my back of my mind rather than dealing with it. When when I have the time to do it.

789
01:05:26.930 --> 01:05:29.800
Dolores Albarracin: How long would it take Lou to do it?

790
01:05:32.480 --> 01:05:37.250
Lewis: Well, I mean just to secure that I that I'm I'm in it. And then to to set up.

791
01:05:37.390 --> 01:05:40.860
Lewis: you know, appointments. And that type of thing would probably only take a day or 2.

792
01:05:41.350 --> 01:05:45.200
Dolores Albarracin: Okay, what do people think? Any thoughts?

793
01:05:46.040 --> 01:05:53.179
Petra Teeter 237121: I was wondering if I know they don't. They didn't send you the physical card.

794
01:05:53.280 --> 01:05:54.110
Patricia Renaud: But.

795
01:05:54.330 --> 01:05:57.920
Petra Teeter 237121: Isn't, and I don't know.

796
01:05:57.980 --> 01:06:02.450
Petra Teeter 237121: I'm just wondering if it's like our health insurance

797
01:06:02.490 --> 01:06:16.549
Petra Teeter 237121: you really like. I really don't need the card. If I just can get the numbers off there. So can these people just give you the numbers and you write it down for yourself. I don't know. I'm just trying right.

798
01:06:16.550 --> 01:06:21.269
Lewis: Right? Right? No. They sent the email. Oh, yes, go ahead. I'm sorry.

799
01:06:21.506 --> 01:06:25.289
john bianculli: Do you have a smartphone and see if your health insurance company has a mobile app.

800
01:06:25.450 --> 01:06:27.749
john bianculli: and then you can just use your smartphone.

801
01:06:28.830 --> 01:06:29.530
Morgan Potts: It's good.

802
01:06:29.530 --> 01:06:31.869
Lewis: Yeah, I I could probably do it that way as well.

803
01:06:32.290 --> 01:06:34.200
john bianculli: Cigna, I mean I would say not.

804
01:06:34.200 --> 01:06:35.229
Lewis: No, I'm not.

805
01:06:37.120 --> 01:06:40.329
john bianculli: I use my yeah, I just use my cell phone

806
01:06:40.350 --> 01:06:47.529
john bianculli: and signal. They have an app in it. That's why. Because my wallet. Everything for me going from Pittsburgh to California.

807
01:06:47.560 --> 01:06:53.689
john bianculli: Some of my cards are mia, but for health insurance, yeah, I use. Yeah. Use our mobile app.

808
01:06:55.010 --> 01:06:55.870
Lewis: Okay.

809
01:06:56.060 --> 01:06:56.490
Dolores Albarracin: Yeah.

810
01:06:57.510 --> 01:06:57.970
Lewis: Definitely.

811
01:06:57.970 --> 01:07:05.079
Dolores Albarracin: To maybe find out if there is a way of figuring out your Medicaid number online by

812
01:07:05.580 --> 01:07:07.340
Dolores Albarracin: Googling, this.

813
01:07:08.260 --> 01:07:08.770
Lewis: So.

814
01:07:08.770 --> 01:07:13.960
Dolores Albarracin: Well, what? What were you saying? Yeah, I mean, I think Jones are good ideas.

815
01:07:15.790 --> 01:07:30.569
Lewis: With both of them is, is just following through. This is my main problem. I will go out and set everything up and then await a response, and then, if I don't get anything in my mind, I've already moved on, and

816
01:07:30.750 --> 01:07:34.419
Lewis: I'm caught up in 4 or 5 different other things I have to do, and

817
01:07:34.590 --> 01:07:38.380
Lewis: then it gets put to the wayside, and then it ends up, being months.

818
01:07:41.460 --> 01:07:43.634
Dolores Albarracin: So it seems like maybe

819
01:07:45.300 --> 01:07:49.720
Dolores Albarracin: setting an alarm on your phone to remind you of this

820
01:07:50.100 --> 01:07:53.229
Dolores Albarracin: by let's say noon every day.

821
01:07:53.570 --> 01:07:54.830
Dolores Albarracin: Think about.

822
01:07:55.340 --> 01:07:57.459
Dolores Albarracin: A Medicaid number.

823
01:07:58.380 --> 01:08:03.729
Dolores Albarracin: Would something like that have some promise of working.

824
01:08:04.880 --> 01:08:16.580
Lewis: Oh, yeah, for for sure is I need to start using using everything that's available on my phone is the calendar app for reminding me of stuff and and keeping me on focus of the stuff I need to get done.

825
01:08:16.680 --> 01:08:18.570
Lewis: because, you know.

826
01:08:18.810 --> 01:08:33.600
Lewis: I feel like I feel like I have Adhd, and never got diagnosed with it, because my mind is always thinking of 10 different things that I need to do or you know. And then you add in the daily routine to that. So then I just end up getting caught up. And then

827
01:08:33.850 --> 01:08:40.500
Lewis: you know the stuff that I had planned on doing. I don't always get everything done. So yes, definitely, I need to start using my calendar app.

828
01:08:41.529 --> 01:08:42.060
Dolores Albarracin: But it.

829
01:08:42.069 --> 01:08:50.539
Dolores Albarracin: it seems like your health is, is not really understandably with everything that's going on, not your priority. Right.

830
01:08:50.540 --> 01:08:57.189
Lewis: Right. That's that's part of it is like I said, I have 5 or 6 different things that I'm stressing over. And then

831
01:08:57.580 --> 01:09:04.770
Lewis: it's like subconsciously in my head. I reorganize what's important and what's not important, or can wait a little while, and then.

832
01:09:04.830 --> 01:09:11.419
Lewis: like I said, it ends up being months before I get back to something. So I definitely need to get that secured. Just to be sure.

833
01:09:11.420 --> 01:09:12.560
Petra Teeter 237121: I have an idea. Louis.

834
01:09:12.560 --> 01:09:13.140
Lewis: And.

835
01:09:13.800 --> 01:09:16.909
Petra Teeter 237121: Didn't you say you have a son? That's how old.

836
01:09:16.910 --> 01:09:17.410
Petra Teeter 237121: Yeah.

837
01:09:18.160 --> 01:09:20.760
Lewis: He will be 18 tomorrow.

838
01:09:20.760 --> 01:09:29.090
Petra Teeter 237121: Okay, okay. So my sons are 26 and 24. However, that's what I do.

839
01:09:29.330 --> 01:09:35.560
Petra Teeter 237121: I go to them. They're gonna explain to you how you get that app and how you get. Just ask him.

840
01:09:35.569 --> 01:09:35.949
Lewis: In.

841
01:09:35.950 --> 01:09:36.929
Petra Teeter 237121: See what I'm saying.

842
01:09:36.939 --> 01:09:37.669
Lewis: Okay.

843
01:09:38.700 --> 01:09:43.920
Petra Teeter 237121: Because they they just like, I don't know. They just know how to do technology. I guess

844
01:09:44.520 --> 01:09:51.710
Petra Teeter 237121: I will be stressing out over. Oh, how am I supposed to do all this and all this technology? And I don't want to do this.

845
01:09:51.870 --> 01:09:52.520
Petra Teeter 237121: And.

846
01:09:52.520 --> 01:09:52.880
Lewis: The New.

847
01:09:52.880 --> 01:09:57.840
Petra Teeter 237121: And there they are, and they grew up with it, and they'll be like, oh, that's easy.

848
01:09:58.740 --> 01:10:00.330
Petra Teeter 237121: Just an idea. I don't know.

849
01:10:00.840 --> 01:10:02.279
Petra Teeter 237121: He may be helpful.

850
01:10:02.280 --> 01:10:03.900
Lewis: You know you're right.

851
01:10:04.890 --> 01:10:05.440
Lewis: You're right.

852
01:10:05.440 --> 01:10:08.999
john bianculli: Did you ever try writing down like 4 major tasks.

853
01:10:09.230 --> 01:10:13.130
john bianculli: and then trying to break those tests into smaller ones to make it more obtainable?

854
01:10:15.333 --> 01:10:21.849
Lewis: Well, I did that initially. When I 1st went through, my situation was to kind of

855
01:10:21.890 --> 01:10:26.599
Lewis: put an order to what needs to get done so that I can get to the main goal was.

856
01:10:26.630 --> 01:10:30.680
Lewis: you know, saving money, making sure that I stay employed

857
01:10:31.283 --> 01:10:34.909
Lewis: keeping my connections, my social connections with people.

858
01:10:35.401 --> 01:10:40.219
Lewis: Just so. I you know, I'm always able to get information. And that type of thing.

859
01:10:41.280 --> 01:10:43.769
john bianculli: Yeah, I mean, like, okay, you said about saving money.

860
01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:45.919
john bianculli: Okay, set a goal this week.

861
01:10:46.010 --> 01:10:48.769
john bianculli: You don't buy coffee out. You make all your own.

862
01:10:48.780 --> 01:10:51.150
john bianculli: That'll a small way of saving money

863
01:10:52.690 --> 01:10:55.379
john bianculli: cut down on your sodas. That'll save you money.

864
01:10:56.940 --> 01:10:58.839
john bianculli: Hopefully. That helped.

865
01:10:59.620 --> 01:11:00.210
Lewis: No?

866
01:11:00.560 --> 01:11:07.539
Lewis: Oh, for sure! No, I appreciate it. It's it's looking at. What you don't necessarily need to spend money on is what I've been doing.

867
01:11:07.740 --> 01:11:08.750
Lewis: So yeah.

868
01:11:08.750 --> 01:11:11.139
john bianculli: Yeah, but for me, I don't. I don't go to Starbucks anymore.

869
01:11:12.038 --> 01:11:15.240
john bianculli: I bought a keurig, and then I used the K-cups. They're a lot cheaper.

870
01:11:15.730 --> 01:11:18.659
john bianculli: and you don't have to tip the barista because you're making it yourself.

871
01:11:20.330 --> 01:11:20.790
Dolores Albarracin: Page.

872
01:11:22.150 --> 01:11:31.239
Dolores Albarracin: So, Lou, it seems like I mean, the insurance card could could be perhaps a pathway to having more connection

873
01:11:31.500 --> 01:11:37.819
Dolores Albarracin: with a whole health system. Yeah, not not just getting the car, but

874
01:11:37.830 --> 01:11:44.809
Dolores Albarracin: there's more support in general. But at the same time it's hard for you to get excited about this.

875
01:11:47.720 --> 01:11:54.149
Lewis: Yeah in my head. It's more like one of the many things that I need to face. And like. I said, I

876
01:11:54.210 --> 01:11:58.150
Lewis: in my mind, I change the order of it every other day. So

877
01:11:58.220 --> 01:12:20.779
Lewis: but being able to talk to you all, and knowing that I'm coming in to talk to you guys about just health in general, in the regard of you know the group and everything that you know it. It gets me more oriented toward that to know that that is something I need to fix before you know, winter really hits. And then I have. Then I could end up, you know, really needing a clinic or a hospital. So.

878
01:12:21.690 --> 01:12:25.577
Dolores Albarracin: So are are you saying that you are gonna

879
01:12:27.330 --> 01:12:30.720
Dolores Albarracin: Do? What for your insurance card for next week?

880
01:12:31.504 --> 01:12:39.759
Lewis: Well, mainly is this going online. But I'll also asking my son if if you know if he's heard of any apps or anything that that's in that regard.

881
01:12:40.192 --> 01:12:44.910
Lewis: Just for checking cause. I know he he's he's gotten more active in

882
01:12:44.960 --> 01:12:47.279
Lewis: his insurance is through his mom.

883
01:12:47.640 --> 01:12:52.879
Lewis: So he's gotten more active than that with him going out to the gym to exercise and

884
01:12:52.950 --> 01:12:55.529
Lewis: playing sports with his friends. And that type of thing.

885
01:12:55.860 --> 01:12:59.230
Lewis: So just keep me focused is would be.

886
01:12:59.230 --> 01:12:59.619
Dolores Albarracin: We'll be.

887
01:12:59.620 --> 01:13:01.670
Lewis: It would be to get on the website.

888
01:13:02.930 --> 01:13:06.430
Dolores Albarracin: So your son is, is being very successful

889
01:13:06.820 --> 01:13:17.160
Dolores Albarracin: with, you know, achieving these health goals or or connecting his mom. And that's a great, great idea. What day would you ask him?

890
01:13:17.220 --> 01:13:18.530
Dolores Albarracin: Where on the.

891
01:13:18.530 --> 01:13:19.220
Lewis: Phone.

892
01:13:19.220 --> 01:13:20.790
Dolores Albarracin: How would you do it?

893
01:13:20.790 --> 01:13:28.659
Lewis: No, I'm I'm planning on seeing him tomorrow drop off his present and talk to him about. You know the milestone of being 18 or whatever.

894
01:13:28.710 --> 01:13:31.250
Lewis: But I'll have time to talk to him about that, too.

895
01:13:32.370 --> 01:13:38.449
Dolores Albarracin: So you'll ask for his help, and and then tell us what happened.

896
01:13:38.680 --> 01:13:39.270
Dolores Albarracin: Okay.

897
01:13:39.270 --> 01:13:39.910
Lewis: Yep.

898
01:13:42.640 --> 01:13:45.089
Dolores Albarracin: That sounds very good. Yeah.

899
01:13:45.720 --> 01:13:50.020
Dolores Albarracin: Any comments on on this plan from others.

900
01:13:52.090 --> 01:13:58.590
Petra Teeter 237121: I do this old fashioned things still to the day, and I don't know. I probably have like

901
01:13:59.130 --> 01:14:01.930
Petra Teeter 237121: autism. Adhd, something.

902
01:14:02.417 --> 01:14:15.220
Petra Teeter 237121: Typically, I will get up in the morning, and I get very anxious about my day specifically, when I have a lot of things to do. And I do this old fashioned thing, and at this point I don't care what anybody says.

903
01:14:15.270 --> 01:14:17.719
Petra Teeter 237121: I have this piece of paper.

904
01:14:17.770 --> 01:14:24.620
Petra Teeter 237121: and I write it down. Sometimes I do that the night before, when I'm anxious before

905
01:14:25.208 --> 01:14:27.859
Petra Teeter 237121: and it does the trick for me.

906
01:14:28.520 --> 01:14:32.809
Petra Teeter 237121: Silly! It's super old fashioned, and it works too

907
01:14:33.160 --> 01:14:35.889
Petra Teeter 237121: old piece of paper and a pencil. That's it.

908
01:14:36.570 --> 01:14:44.969
Dolores Albarracin: And now then, we're talking about you. So how about your health, Petra? What would you like to achieve.

909
01:14:47.510 --> 01:14:55.439
Petra Teeter 237121: I like, I said. It's been going on for 18 years. I've seen about every doctor in whatever, and it's

910
01:14:55.450 --> 01:15:00.339
Petra Teeter 237121: everybody's just interested in prescribing me medication. I'm not.

911
01:15:00.570 --> 01:15:04.051
Petra Teeter 237121: I want to get to the bottom of this just

912
01:15:04.500 --> 01:15:09.999
Petra Teeter 237121: you know, giving me something to turn me into a vegetable is not helping.

913
01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:10.390
Dolores Albarracin: Okay.

914
01:15:10.390 --> 01:15:14.909
Petra Teeter 237121: And and I'm just like I said before, I'm very stubborn, and maybe that's a good thing.

915
01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:20.879
Petra Teeter 237121: And so I try a lot of things from physical therapy to

916
01:15:21.348 --> 01:15:25.029
Petra Teeter 237121: supplements. I do a lot of research on them.

917
01:15:25.310 --> 01:15:33.269
Petra Teeter 237121: And I ask around, I have a relative who is a oh, goodness, some kind of

918
01:15:34.710 --> 01:15:37.653
Petra Teeter 237121: it's a it's. It's a nurse, but it's for

919
01:15:39.910 --> 01:15:47.839
Petra Teeter 237121: She is not going to give you medication. It's more of a healthy lifestyle kind of functional medicine type, nurse.

920
01:15:48.530 --> 01:15:52.099
Petra Teeter 237121: And you're you're seeing this nurse already, Petra.

921
01:15:52.100 --> 01:16:01.020
Petra Teeter 237121: Well, she is my relative, so she's 1 of my really what I call good connections. She's my husband's cousin. So there you go.

922
01:16:01.020 --> 01:16:01.640
Dolores Albarracin: And

923
01:16:02.270 --> 01:16:13.199
Dolores Albarracin: and you're already talking with her. Or would this be a new thing? So so that's already taken care of? Is there something you're not doing that you would like to do for your health.

924
01:16:14.180 --> 01:16:20.570
Petra Teeter 237121: No, but I'm very well. I don't know what I'm not doing, but the pain is there, and

925
01:16:23.810 --> 01:16:27.950
Petra Teeter 237121: yes, so I'm very open to suggestions.

926
01:16:28.370 --> 01:16:36.829
Dolores Albarracin: No, I don't have any suggestions for the pain, but maybe for you know, some, some hobby or something that takes your mind off it.

927
01:16:38.390 --> 01:16:40.359
Petra Teeter 237121: Stress relief is what you're saying.

928
01:16:41.210 --> 01:16:45.650
Petra Teeter 237121: Stress relief is what you're saying, or, Yeah.

929
01:16:46.770 --> 01:16:48.290
Dolores Albarracin: Do you have any hobbies.

930
01:16:50.160 --> 01:17:08.680
Petra Teeter 237121: I've never really been a real hobby person. I guess the the one thing before I moved to the United States. I love traveling, and by that I don't mean expensive or anything. But I just love getting to different places, meeting

931
01:17:09.160 --> 01:17:10.333
Petra Teeter 237121: new people,

932
01:17:10.950 --> 01:17:21.639
Petra Teeter 237121: finding new landscapes, that kind of thing just really exploring a new area typically rather off the beaten path than I don't like tourism. So

933
01:17:21.820 --> 01:17:29.588
Petra Teeter 237121: that was one of those things I really enjoyed moving to the Us. That pretty much didn't happen

934
01:17:30.670 --> 01:17:31.820
Petra Teeter 237121: a little bit, but.

935
01:17:31.820 --> 01:17:32.370
Dolores Albarracin: How many days.

936
01:17:32.370 --> 01:17:32.750
Petra Teeter 237121: Much.

937
01:17:32.750 --> 01:17:36.960
Dolores Albarracin: Where? Where? Where? Where? Are you again right now?

938
01:17:36.960 --> 01:17:40.570
Petra Teeter 237121: So in the Raleigh, Durham, North Carolina, area.

939
01:17:40.710 --> 01:17:44.099
Dolores Albarracin: Okay. So that's a very nice place. So a little.

940
01:17:44.580 --> 01:17:51.289
Petra Teeter 237121: Yes, it's a nicer than many other places I've lived in as far as outdoors, and yes.

941
01:17:51.290 --> 01:17:58.089
Dolores Albarracin: So could you make a plan to do some activity? Go out to a place you like.

942
01:17:58.090 --> 01:17:58.410
Petra Teeter 237121: We.

943
01:17:58.410 --> 01:17:59.000
Dolores Albarracin: That's.

944
01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:00.777
Petra Teeter 237121: Yes, I guess.

945
01:18:01.480 --> 01:18:08.729
Petra Teeter 237121: We go we we bought a few years ago a a piece of land. It's

946
01:18:08.810 --> 01:18:18.670
Petra Teeter 237121: there's nothing on it. Just trees and a little bit of. We cut some trees down, and I have a little garden there. I seem to enjoy that.

947
01:18:19.290 --> 01:18:21.139
Petra Teeter 237121: I know it's silly, but.

948
01:18:21.140 --> 01:18:24.700
Dolores Albarracin: Sounds very, very German thing to do.

949
01:18:24.750 --> 01:18:25.760
Petra Teeter 237121: I guess

950
01:18:26.130 --> 01:18:39.388
Petra Teeter 237121: I guess so. And I I actually love it. I I'll bring home my my tomatoes and my green beans, and and basically make everybody eat it.

951
01:18:40.130 --> 01:18:42.711
Petra Teeter 237121: They're just quiet. And they're like, yes, it's great. Mom.

952
01:18:42.970 --> 01:18:45.349
Dolores Albarracin: Are you gonna go in the next week?

953
01:18:45.870 --> 01:18:49.909
Petra Teeter 237121: Yes, typically once, typically on Saturdays.

954
01:18:49.990 --> 01:18:56.886
Petra Teeter 237121: So unless the weather is not good, and then just on Sundays, but that's something we've been doing

955
01:18:57.500 --> 01:19:01.540
Petra Teeter 237121: and sometimes just working on in the woods out there is good

956
01:19:03.060 --> 01:19:08.875
Petra Teeter 237121: There's also another thing in my own neighborhood here where I live.

957
01:19:09.840 --> 01:19:11.440
Petra Teeter 237121: That's I.

958
01:19:11.730 --> 01:19:15.220
Petra Teeter 237121: The the neighbors are kind of stuck up, in my opinion.

959
01:19:15.300 --> 01:19:27.199
Petra Teeter 237121: and I'm not. I'm friendly with everybody, but I don't really care for them. So when we go out to our land in the it's over toward the mountains of North Carolina.

960
01:19:27.500 --> 01:19:36.370
Petra Teeter 237121: And and like I said, it's just land, and there's nothing else there. It's just the woods, that's what's so good about it. And the next door neighbor is is

961
01:19:36.700 --> 01:19:48.450
Petra Teeter 237121: away. You gotta almost like hike to him. Them and we just got along really good with those people, and it's just nice to like, I said before, I rather just.

962
01:19:48.700 --> 01:19:52.400
Petra Teeter 237121: I don't really need any friends, but it's nice to have somebody where

963
01:19:52.825 --> 01:19:56.299
Petra Teeter 237121: you you feel like we can talk to them about anything.

964
01:19:56.300 --> 01:20:01.480
Dolores Albarracin: Maybe on Saturday, a short visit to your neighbors in the country.

965
01:20:01.690 --> 01:20:07.690
Petra Teeter 237121: We do. We make that a point every time, and they've been asking for it. So because I don't want

966
01:20:08.180 --> 01:20:08.690
Petra Teeter 237121: annoying.

967
01:20:08.690 --> 01:20:13.279
Dolores Albarracin: Nothing, nothing else you could possibly be doing, it seems. Yeah.

968
01:20:14.120 --> 01:20:14.710
Petra Teeter 237121: What's that?

969
01:20:15.210 --> 01:20:20.670
Dolores Albarracin: Nothing else to to add into the mix. You're doing everything you want.

970
01:20:21.180 --> 01:20:24.689
Dolores Albarracin: or could you add something else to that little trip?

971
01:20:24.780 --> 01:20:29.709
Petra Teeter 237121: Right. I am pretty like I don't know. I've

972
01:20:30.600 --> 01:20:37.410
Petra Teeter 237121: always had a lot of boulders in my way. Growing up so

973
01:20:38.070 --> 01:20:43.939
Petra Teeter 237121: I just I guess I made it a thing to overcome everything. I don't want to, but I just do

974
01:20:44.730 --> 01:20:45.570
Petra Teeter 237121: so.

975
01:20:45.570 --> 01:20:50.030
Dolores Albarracin: Okay, alright. So frank

976
01:20:53.410 --> 01:20:54.310
Dolores Albarracin: health.

977
01:20:55.550 --> 01:20:56.870
Frank: I'm muting, Okay.

978
01:21:00.350 --> 01:21:01.810
Frank: what was the question? I'm sorry.

979
01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:05.170
Dolores Albarracin: Your health. What would you like to do for your health?

980
01:21:06.309 --> 01:21:11.579
Frank: So I I'd like to actually do my Pt. At

981
01:21:11.770 --> 01:21:20.489
Frank: home. I'm going twice a week, but I am supposed to do it every day. I'm not going to do it every day, but I'd like to do it at least

982
01:21:20.899 --> 01:21:27.189
Frank: twice a week. While I'm at home. So then I'm I'm doing the exercises 4 times a week, you know.

983
01:21:28.320 --> 01:21:31.589
Frank: I think, is is, you know, better than just twice a week. So.

984
01:21:31.950 --> 01:21:34.690
Dolores Albarracin: And what would that take to.

985
01:21:34.980 --> 01:21:36.120
Frank: To do that.

986
01:21:36.240 --> 01:21:36.860
Dolores Albarracin: One.

987
01:21:38.820 --> 01:21:49.517
Frank: I mean I have the time, and I I you know I I can do it from you know the comfort of my own home. I mean, there's you know. I have a mat, and I have the straps and everything that I can use.

988
01:21:50.360 --> 01:21:56.967
Frank: So I just have to set aside some time, and for me that would probably be evening.

989
01:21:58.482 --> 01:22:08.490
Frank: evening to night. Kind of time is when I'm I have the most energy. So say, Tuesday.

990
01:22:09.124 --> 01:22:16.340
Frank: My! My wife's having surgery the next tomorrow, so I kind of be

991
01:22:16.769 --> 01:22:19.649
Frank: tied up with the hospital for the next couple of days, but

992
01:22:23.960 --> 01:22:28.400
Frank: I could likely do it say Friday and Sunday.

993
01:22:29.380 --> 01:22:31.159
Frank: so that I have a day in between.

994
01:22:31.420 --> 01:22:33.019
Dolores Albarracin: How long would it take.

995
01:22:35.820 --> 01:22:37.250
Frank: It's about

996
01:22:39.300 --> 01:22:51.679
Frank: like when I go to the the physical therapy center. It's an hour. But there's kind of a lot of in between stuff and like massage afterwards. So I I think about 30, 40 min it would take.

997
01:22:55.220 --> 01:22:59.759
Frank: So I set aside an hour total, just to like, you know. Warm up. Yeah.

998
01:22:59.760 --> 01:23:06.150
Dolores Albarracin: So it's it's thinking of doing it twice, lot you think, or.

999
01:23:06.980 --> 01:23:09.818
Frank: No, I think it's manageable, I mean

1000
01:23:10.950 --> 01:23:17.400
Frank: for me to do it every day, I think is a lot I wouldn't. I just wouldn't do it, so I don't want to set myself up to fail.

1001
01:23:17.740 --> 01:23:24.130
Frank: I think twice is is reasonable, and I think it'll give me some benefits, so.

1002
01:23:25.980 --> 01:23:31.647
Dolores Albarracin: Okay, so Friday and Sunday, could anything happen like, let's say you're

1003
01:23:32.140 --> 01:23:35.820
Dolores Albarracin: partner surgery. What? What type of surgery is it.

1004
01:23:36.340 --> 01:23:51.309
Frank: Yeah. So I don't really want to discuss the specifics of it. But it's a it's a fairly major surgery. So she's expected to stay overnight, at least. So if there's any like

1005
01:23:51.430 --> 01:23:56.489
Frank: complications, or if they have to cut her up in

1006
01:23:56.580 --> 01:24:05.160
Frank: instead of having to do it, laparoscopic is what they're going to aim for. But if they have to open her up, then there's going to be more time that she's going to have to stay in hospital so

1007
01:24:05.170 --> 01:24:07.960
Frank: that could potentially get in my way.

1008
01:24:07.960 --> 01:24:15.389
Dolores Albarracin: Yeah, this could be a bad week. Yeah, for to do it twice. Yeah.

1009
01:24:16.270 --> 01:24:18.719
Dolores Albarracin: How about one time? Then maybe.

1010
01:24:18.720 --> 01:24:25.140
Frank: One time. Sure, yeah, and and that'll give her time to, you know.

1011
01:24:26.490 --> 01:24:33.229
Frank: Get home. And yeah, for for us to get settled in.

1012
01:24:33.550 --> 01:24:41.090
Dolores Albarracin: Do you have something set up for for your own support while you're supporting her in the coming week?

1013
01:24:42.407 --> 01:24:46.730
Frank: I mean, I have my sponsor. I you know that's

1014
01:24:47.440 --> 01:24:51.843
Frank: that's there, for you know any reason. And I have my

1015
01:24:52.982 --> 01:24:58.469
Frank: Ca, groups and there's a a trans masculine support group that I

1016
01:24:58.550 --> 01:25:03.660
Frank: haven't been going to recently, but it's there like as an option if I need it.

1017
01:25:04.460 --> 01:25:07.090
Dolores Albarracin: Good good, that's good to know.

1018
01:25:07.240 --> 01:25:08.210
Dolores Albarracin: Well, we're we're.

1019
01:25:08.210 --> 01:25:09.730
Frank: All on zoom so.

1020
01:25:09.990 --> 01:25:13.060
Dolores Albarracin: Yeah. Any thoughts for for Frank.

1021
01:25:14.580 --> 01:25:16.960
Morgan Potts: Hope everything goes well for her tomorrow.

1022
01:25:17.310 --> 01:25:18.050
Frank: Thank you.

1023
01:25:18.230 --> 01:25:22.669
Dolores Albarracin: Yes, yeah, we should recover as quickly. And

1024
01:25:23.600 --> 01:25:35.200
Dolores Albarracin: you're all doing well. So we look forward to to hearing about the surgery and and what's happening when your extra day of Pt. At home? Yeah.

1025
01:25:35.800 --> 01:25:39.700
Dolores Albarracin: So we're coming to an end. So I'd like to just

1026
01:25:39.950 --> 01:25:46.080
Dolores Albarracin: let's see if oh, sorry I forgot Michelle Michelle.

1027
01:25:46.200 --> 01:25:52.359
Dolores Albarracin: at least briefly, because you you came in late, are you? Are you able to unmute yourself?

1028
01:25:55.730 --> 01:26:02.310
Dolores Albarracin: I don't know that you can, but I know Michelle was

1029
01:26:02.470 --> 01:26:15.450
Dolores Albarracin: doing overall pretty well, and and she was participating, if I remember correctly. Oh, there, there! Okay, yeah. Jennifer. Oh, Jennifer, okay.

1030
01:26:15.850 --> 01:26:17.140
Dolores Albarracin: Standard product.

1031
01:26:18.020 --> 01:26:21.340
Dolores Albarracin: So, Jennifer, can you unmute yourself?

1032
01:26:24.360 --> 01:26:28.320
Dolores Albarracin: No, it doesn't seem possible.

1033
01:26:28.430 --> 01:26:29.370
Dolores Albarracin: But.

1034
01:26:29.520 --> 01:26:34.010
Patricia Renaud: She was gonna watch a movie with her mom to

1035
01:26:35.170 --> 01:26:42.349
Dolores Albarracin: Control her mom's criticism. So I look forward to hearing next week Jennifer.

1036
01:26:42.550 --> 01:26:50.729
Dolores Albarracin: But before we go, anything you'd like to say to others. Thank the group for please go ahead.

1037
01:26:55.100 --> 01:27:01.390
Lewis: Well, I just wanted to say, like overall like, it's it's good to talk to people that are kind

1038
01:27:01.570 --> 01:27:08.590
Lewis: that aren't giving any type of judgment in whatever we discuss and and share with the group. So I appreciate that

1039
01:27:09.081 --> 01:27:16.520
Lewis: because my fit, my friend Circle, has certainly gotten small in the last 2 to 4 years. So it's appreciated.

1040
01:27:20.080 --> 01:27:24.830
Petra Teeter 237121: Always, I guess. Remember, you don't need a lot of friends. Just one good friend will do

1041
01:27:25.630 --> 01:27:26.912
Petra Teeter 237121: how I feel.

1042
01:27:28.100 --> 01:27:29.740
Petra Teeter 237121: Just one person right.

1043
01:27:29.740 --> 01:27:32.610
Dolores Albarracin: Well, sometimes the more the merrier.

1044
01:27:32.850 --> 01:27:39.470
Petra Teeter 237121: Yes, it could be. But I'm just saying, if it all comes down to it rather just that one real good one, right?

1045
01:27:44.090 --> 01:27:49.920
Lewis: Very true. I just double down on the people that that I trust, and and already

1046
01:27:50.240 --> 01:27:57.489
Lewis: already have seen, that they they're wanting to continue a friendship which is mainly my family. But yeah.

1047
01:27:57.940 --> 01:28:15.169
Dolores Albarracin: Yeah, I want to say how impressed I am by everybody's ability to support others and and jump in and and problem solve. It's it's remarkable. And and you come up with a lot of ideas and solutions for everybody. So that's that's great

1048
01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:17.619
Dolores Albarracin: final warrant.

1049
01:28:17.620 --> 01:28:27.510
john bianculli: One thing about this time of the year, a really good time of the year to make amend, especially with Thanksgiving and Christmas. You can kind of write off the coat tails.

1050
01:28:27.720 --> 01:28:34.360
john bianculli: because usually this time of the year people tend to be more open and respect and receptive of forgiving, especially New Year's Eve.

1051
01:28:34.390 --> 01:28:36.880
