And my goal for today is to talk about the kinds of changes to our social lives that we'd like to make. And I'm going to give you a couple of examples that we all have. We all have somebody in our lives with whom we become disconnected sometimes, you know there. There was some issue that led to. and a strange relationship other times, just you know, nothing in particular, but we haven't seen them, or there could be more serious splits with somebody. So I'm thinking, in particular, of situations in which for each of you, we're gonna have this discussion for each of you. whether there is a relationship, a person in your life with whom you would like to reconnect or or change something in relation to them. or whether perhaps you'd like to meet somebody new or or a new group new social activity. So it could be also something else. As long as it's related to our relationships with other people. And the reason we start with this is, it's just so important to who we are and and how we feel those connections with others, and sometimes they get lost or or we have less than we want. So that's the main topic for today. And I'd like to start with anybody who has something to say.",9,[3],"Dolores outlines the session's main topic and goals, focusing on social connections.",0,0,0,0,1,00:09:10.790,49,0,Dolores Albarracin,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

That's the main thing, because there's people that pretend to care. And then there's people that don't really care that don't realize it until you know it's been half a year, or even a year from now and then they go. Oh, wait! Where's John at? You know?

I was struck by a vehicle in 2021, the end of 2022. I had a hernia. and each of those each of those incidents caused me to lose the job that I had so just in the last 2 years.

So I always had the optimism that she would come back from the hospital where everything would be fine. She was telling me. You know, we'll we'll worry about the rent and all that stuff later, and that type of thing. And then, you know, that happened. And I ended up meeting her family that I'd never even met before.
