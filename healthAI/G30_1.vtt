Dolores Albarracin: where we would like to see changes or

39
00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:43.079
Dolores Albarracin: things we'd like to change. But before going into more

40
00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:45.330
Dolores Albarracin: details, let me

41
00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:47.809
Dolores Albarracin: call on each of you to

42
00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:52.570
Dolores Albarracin: tell us you know your name, maybe your state.

43
00:02:52.610 --> 00:03:01.750
Dolores Albarracin: perhaps also who you're living with? And are you working or not? And if you're working, what are you doing, Jamie?

Dolores Albarracin: What kind of

48
00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:27.190
Dolores Albarracin: clinical research Jamie.

49
00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:30.950
Jamie F: I worked in clinical trials. I have a master's in pharmacology, and

50
00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:36.429
Jamie F: so I did a lot more to do with the regulatory side of things, but some patient care.

51
00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:38.320

Petra Teeter 237121: military reserves. So. But

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:31.470
Dolores Albarracin: Yeah.

82
00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:36.229
Dolores Albarracin: you have to unmute yourself. The little icon on the bottom left.

83
00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:41.190
john bianculli: There we go. I think I just got it.

84
00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:46.249
john bianculli: Okay. Well, I'm currently in California, in rehab

85
00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:52.489
john bianculli: coming back to Pittsburgh back on the end of my job. December the second.

86
00:05:55.030 --> 00:06:00.950
Dolores Albarracin: Okay. So Pennsylvania, too. So when you're back in Pittsburgh, who do you live with.

87
00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:07.390
john bianculli: We haven't gotten that far. I have to work on how.

88
00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:10.080
Dolores Albarracin: Okay, you don't know yet.

89
00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:14.310
Dolores Albarracin: And in the past, were you living by yourself

90
00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:16.840
Dolores Albarracin: with somebody family friend.

91
00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:19.089
john bianculli: Kind of on and off again. Roommate.

92
00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:20.200
Dolores Albarracin: Okay.

93
00:06:21.970 --> 00:06:23.190
Dolores Albarracin: Michelle.

94
00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:31.399
Michelle: Hi! I'm Michelle. I'm from Virginia. I'm a behavior therapist, and I live alone.

95
00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:40.049
Dolores Albarracin: Okay. Nice to meet you, Louis.

96
00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:58.369
Lewis: Unmuted. Hey? I'm Lewis. I can also go by Lou. Try not to go by Lou with people I don't know, because it sounds too much like you, but I've lived in Northern Virginia majority of my life about 35 miles from DC.

97
00:06:58.878 --> 00:07:26.881
Lewis: Right now I'm in between jobs. But I've had numerous experiences in customer service, retail sales, cooking, serving. I'm everywhere. So just looking for a job hopefully for the holidays to you know. Support all of the holiday season. I have a 17 year old, son. That will be turning 18 before the end of the month, and that was one of the major reasons, or one of the reasons I did wanna get into the survey and and talk to you guys.

98
00:07:28.850 --> 00:07:31.409
Dolores Albarracin: Do you live with him? With him, Lou?

99
00:07:32.395 --> 00:07:45.109
Lewis: Currently in between finding a place to stay. I was not able to pay for my rent after having a hernia operation last year my warehouse job took me off to schedule

100
00:07:45.719 --> 00:07:51.310
Lewis: but from that point I've been, you know, working odd jobs back and forth.

101
00:07:51.731 --> 00:08:03.238
Lewis: I did have a job with the inventory specialist place for about 3 months, and that ended in the end of summertime. About beginning of August or middle of August.

102
00:08:06.060 --> 00:08:08.839
Dolores Albarracin: Okay. Nice to meet you

103
00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:13.090
Dolores Albarracin: and Morgan

104
00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:17.970
Dolores Albarracin: Morgan.

105
00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:22.439
Dolores Albarracin: can you please turn on your camera and unmute yourself?

106
00:08:26.290 --> 00:08:27.479
Dolores Albarracin: We can see.

107
00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:33.719
Morgan Potts: Hey, guys, hey, guys, I just got in the door literally just got in the door from work, and I will

108
00:08:33.750 --> 00:08:38.979
Morgan Potts: get the video. Go. Oh, shizzlement! Can you request that again, please, ma'am? I'm sorry about.

109
00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:47.520
Dolores Albarracin: Yes, yeah, if you can turn on your video and and audio, and you have your audio on now. So that's good.

110
00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:47.980
Morgan Potts: Up there.

111
00:08:47.980 --> 00:08:55.179
Dolores Albarracin: I mean your name. What state you're calling from, who you live with? And and if you're working, what are you doing.

112
00:08:55.180 --> 00:09:04.630
Morgan Potts: Okay, here, I'm here. Sorry, guys. I'm literally just walking in the door. I am in North Carolina, and I work in local government.

113
00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:06.800
Morgan Potts: and I live alone.

114
00:09:10.790 --> 00:09:12.694
Dolores Albarracin: Great. Well, it's

115
00:09:14.190 --> 00:09:17.780
Dolores Albarracin: again, really nice to meet you. We're a fairly

116
00:09:18.290 --> 00:09:25.650
Dolores Albarracin: sizable group. So it's gonna make things interesting. We have an hour and a half today.

117
00:09:26.110 --> 00:09:29.680
Dolores Albarracin: And my goal for today is to

118
00:09:30.520 --> 00:09:32.750
Dolores Albarracin: talk about the

119
00:09:33.790 --> 00:09:35.810
Dolores Albarracin: kinds of

120
00:09:36.500 --> 00:09:40.490
Dolores Albarracin: changes to our social lives that we'd like to make.

121
00:09:40.990 --> 00:09:46.269
Dolores Albarracin: And I'm going to give you a couple of examples that we all have. We all have somebody

122
00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:48.550
Dolores Albarracin: in our lives

123
00:09:49.020 --> 00:09:56.270
Dolores Albarracin: with whom we become disconnected sometimes, you know there. There was some issue that led to.

124
00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.419
Dolores Albarracin: and a strange relationship other times, just

125
00:10:00.810 --> 00:10:09.440
Dolores Albarracin: you know, nothing in particular, but we haven't seen them, or there could be more serious splits with somebody.

126
00:10:09.640 --> 00:10:15.229
Dolores Albarracin: So I'm thinking, in particular, of situations in which

127
00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:18.710
Dolores Albarracin: for each of you, we're gonna have this discussion for each of you.

128
00:10:19.070 --> 00:10:20.490
Dolores Albarracin: whether there is

129
00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:29.310
Dolores Albarracin: a relationship, a person in your life with whom you would like to reconnect or or change something in relation to them.

130
00:10:29.590 --> 00:10:30.740
Dolores Albarracin: or

131
00:10:31.390 --> 00:10:36.489
Dolores Albarracin: whether perhaps you'd like to meet somebody new or or

132
00:10:36.580 --> 00:10:38.180
Dolores Albarracin: a new group

133
00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:44.990
Dolores Albarracin: new social activity. So it could be also something else. As long as it's related to

134
00:10:45.230 --> 00:11:04.100
Dolores Albarracin: our relationships with other people. And the reason we start with this is, it's just so important to who we are and and how we feel those connections with others, and sometimes they get lost or or we have less than we want. So

135
00:11:04.650 --> 00:11:06.040
Dolores Albarracin: that's the

136
00:11:06.990 --> 00:11:12.940
Dolores Albarracin: main topic for today. And I'd like to start with anybody who has something to say.

137
00:11:14.970 --> 00:11:16.350
Patricia Renaud: I could go first.st

138
00:11:16.560 --> 00:11:17.520
Dolores Albarracin: All right.

139
00:11:20.210 --> 00:11:30.630
Patricia Renaud: I would probably say my son's girlfriend. We don't see eye to eye on things because of the grandkids.

140
00:11:31.030 --> 00:11:34.084
Patricia Renaud: She likes to do a lot of things her way.

141
00:11:34.570 --> 00:11:37.570
Patricia Renaud: which I don't agree with, so

142
00:11:37.740 --> 00:11:42.200
Patricia Renaud: that causes some clashes between us. So

143
00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:46.600
Patricia Renaud: we're looking, maybe to, you know, work on that in the future.

144
00:11:47.530 --> 00:11:48.330
Dolores Albarracin: And

145
00:11:49.470 --> 00:11:53.110
Dolores Albarracin: the girlfriend that is living with you right now.

146
00:11:53.386 --> 00:11:55.869
Patricia Renaud: With my son. No, they don't live with us.

147
00:11:56.200 --> 00:11:57.520
Dolores Albarracin: Not with you. Okay.

148
00:11:57.780 --> 00:12:01.349
Patricia Renaud: Just myself and my fiance are living together.

149
00:12:01.650 --> 00:12:10.500
Dolores Albarracin: Now, what's what's an example of something that has happened that could kind of illustrate the issue, for it.

150
00:12:12.207 --> 00:12:20.799
Patricia Renaud: Probably the way she spends money. It's more on herself than helping out with the household bills.

151
00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:26.100
Dolores Albarracin: Okay.

152
00:12:26.210 --> 00:12:28.850
Dolores Albarracin: so how long

153
00:12:28.940 --> 00:12:31.530
Dolores Albarracin: has the relationship been

154
00:12:31.860 --> 00:12:33.150
Dolores Albarracin: difficult

155
00:12:33.180 --> 00:12:34.390
Dolores Albarracin: for you?

156
00:12:34.390 --> 00:12:42.290
Patricia Renaud: They've been together probably 8 years, and my grandsons are 5 and 6. So from the beginning

157
00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:46.399
Patricia Renaud: she does have an she does have another

158
00:12:46.650 --> 00:12:51.740
Patricia Renaud: 2 children with another person, but they don't live with her.

159
00:12:54.510 --> 00:13:07.739
Dolores Albarracin: So what would you like to change in in how you relate to her? And and of course anybody can jump in and and ask Pat questions. Yeah, and I'll I'll invite all of you to

160
00:13:08.130 --> 00:13:13.420
Dolores Albarracin: to also speak when when you know there is a particular space.

161
00:13:13.460 --> 00:13:18.630
Dolores Albarracin: Yeah, what would you like to to change in in how you relate to her. Pat.

162
00:13:19.168 --> 00:13:22.850
Patricia Renaud: Communication, I think, just to, you know, make it better

163
00:13:23.380 --> 00:13:24.380
Patricia Renaud: for

164
00:13:24.830 --> 00:13:29.880
Patricia Renaud: the relationship to go smoother just for the grandkids sake.

165
00:13:32.820 --> 00:13:38.869
Patricia Renaud: We don't necessarily we have our differences, but we don't fight in front of them just.

166
00:13:38.870 --> 00:13:39.410
Dolores Albarracin: Content.

167
00:13:39.410 --> 00:13:44.989
Patricia Renaud: Disagreements. I think opening a line of communication would help more.

168
00:13:45.710 --> 00:13:48.110
Dolores Albarracin: Would you, I mean, have you discussed.

169
00:13:48.370 --> 00:13:48.800
Patricia Renaud: Yeah.

170
00:13:49.230 --> 00:13:50.180
Dolores Albarracin: Agreements.

171
00:13:51.150 --> 00:13:58.804
Patricia Renaud: Yeah, we have. It seems more on her end. She's more selfish. I see it that way.

172
00:14:00.290 --> 00:14:02.460
Patricia Renaud: it's just difficult.

173
00:14:04.840 --> 00:14:09.679
Dolores Albarracin: Yeah. And and where is your son in in this situation?

174
00:14:10.865 --> 00:14:11.480
Patricia Renaud: He

175
00:14:11.490 --> 00:14:18.520
Patricia Renaud: pretty much pays all of the bills. She works part-time, and what she makes goes

176
00:14:19.310 --> 00:14:20.450
Patricia Renaud: for her.

177
00:14:20.540 --> 00:14:24.759
Patricia Renaud: It doesn't go to help with the mortgage or the bills.

178
00:14:25.222 --> 00:14:29.980
Patricia Renaud: It's pretty much the way I see it me me so

179
00:14:30.180 --> 00:14:39.659
Patricia Renaud: it's hard to not say anything. So usually when you know they come over. She doesn't come along.

180
00:14:39.790 --> 00:14:45.300
Patricia Renaud: And now that they're at the age where they're thinking, Well, why doesn't Mom come along

181
00:14:45.660 --> 00:14:46.405
Patricia Renaud: so.

182
00:14:49.100 --> 00:14:58.810
Dolores Albarracin: So I'm I'm just trying to to imagine how this could play out. Yeah, I mean, if you communicate more of your concerns to her.

183
00:14:59.270 --> 00:15:01.890
Dolores Albarracin: I imagine she's not gonna

184
00:15:02.040 --> 00:15:05.550
Dolores Albarracin: want to know about them right? And that might cost

185
00:15:05.880 --> 00:15:07.800
Dolores Albarracin: significant issues.

186
00:15:07.800 --> 00:15:15.129
Patricia Renaud: Yeah. And so I just try to like, avoid the subject. But we really shouldn't.

187
00:15:16.320 --> 00:15:17.020
Dolores Albarracin: And

188
00:15:19.760 --> 00:15:22.239
Dolores Albarracin: just trying to understand this. But

189
00:15:23.630 --> 00:15:32.459
Dolores Albarracin: why is is this your issue, instead of being your son's concern, or is he also concerned.

190
00:15:32.460 --> 00:15:39.460
Patricia Renaud: Yeah, he is. He tries to not get involved between. He doesn't want to get caught in the middle.

191
00:15:39.880 --> 00:15:41.840
Patricia Renaud: so I think he kind of

192
00:15:42.080 --> 00:15:43.460
Patricia Renaud: stays out of it.

193
00:15:43.460 --> 00:15:44.770
Frank: Can I say something?

194
00:15:45.110 --> 00:15:45.880
Dolores Albarracin: Please.

195
00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:50.230
Frank: I think what what Dolores is trying to ask is like.

196
00:15:50.580 --> 00:16:05.240
Frank: and I could be wrong. So let me know if I'm wrong, but kind of like. What business is it of yours like? It's their financial situation and their you know, paying of bills. And if it works for them, why does it concern you.

197
00:16:05.620 --> 00:16:09.489
Patricia Renaud: Because it really doesn't work for them, he

198
00:16:09.930 --> 00:16:15.780
Patricia Renaud: tells her all the time. You know, you need to contribute, and it just doesn't sink into her.

199
00:16:16.260 --> 00:16:22.040
Frank: I know. But why? Why do you have to insert yourself, I guess, is is the question.

200
00:16:24.030 --> 00:16:25.798
Lewis: I can answer that.

201
00:16:26.330 --> 00:16:51.320
Lewis: I would say in that situation I'm sorry to interrupt, I would say in that situation it's more like you're protective of your child overall. You want to see them succeed. You want to see everything go well in their life. So when there's kind of like, you know some type of issue in it, you know. She's trying to guide him to make sure that he has the right mindset, for you know the the position. He's put himself in.

202
00:16:51.570 --> 00:16:54.259
Frank: I can understand guiding him, but not her.

203
00:16:54.570 --> 00:16:55.120
Frank: It doesn't.

204
00:16:55.120 --> 00:16:55.600
Dolores Albarracin: Makes sense to me.

205
00:16:55.600 --> 00:16:57.729
Frank: But but that's my opinion. I mean.

206
00:16:57.730 --> 00:17:04.280
Dolores Albarracin: No, these are all great points. I'm still trying to to get this, but.

207
00:17:04.630 --> 00:17:05.650
john bianculli: Well, I mean it's.

208
00:17:05.650 --> 00:17:06.650
Dolores Albarracin: Bit unfair.

209
00:17:06.650 --> 00:17:07.270
john bianculli: And.

210
00:17:07.270 --> 00:17:08.310
Dolores Albarracin: Yeah, somebody else wants.

211
00:17:08.310 --> 00:17:08.830
john bianculli: Is she a.

212
00:17:09.479 --> 00:17:12.679
Dolores Albarracin: Ask one question from Pat.

213
00:17:12.939 --> 00:17:14.129
Dolores Albarracin: which is.

214
00:17:14.289 --> 00:17:17.299
Dolores Albarracin: do you feel this is unfair to you?

215
00:17:17.619 --> 00:17:18.829
Dolores Albarracin: Then you're

216
00:17:19.569 --> 00:17:27.379
Dolores Albarracin: son, somehow is, is, you know, making you aware of these concerns, but you really don't do anything about it.

217
00:17:27.990 --> 00:17:34.399
Patricia Renaud: I feel he's just, you know, working his butt off, and she doesn't contribute anything to

218
00:17:35.600 --> 00:17:36.929
Patricia Renaud: the kids.

219
00:17:37.680 --> 00:17:44.290
Patricia Renaud: even providing, you know, groceries. He takes the brunt of everything, and I just don't feel

220
00:17:44.640 --> 00:17:45.750
Patricia Renaud: that's right.

221
00:17:46.230 --> 00:17:48.420
Patricia Renaud: If there's something they need

222
00:17:48.950 --> 00:17:55.869
Patricia Renaud: in particular socks and underwear, I mean the kids come with mismatched socks to my house, and it's like.

223
00:17:55.980 --> 00:17:59.260
Patricia Renaud: Why can't you buy them these things?

224
00:17:59.470 --> 00:18:01.449
Patricia Renaud: And she's like, well.

225
00:18:01.690 --> 00:18:15.630
Patricia Renaud: I needed this. I needed that, and it's like you need to step up and think of your family first, st before you know, provide what they need, and then what's left for yourself.

226
00:18:15.880 --> 00:18:20.949
Dolores Albarracin: But, Pat, it's also very unfair to you, for because this is

227
00:18:21.460 --> 00:18:28.019
Dolores Albarracin: your son's life. Yeah, he's chosen his girlfriend. He's had children with her.

228
00:18:28.520 --> 00:18:31.329
Dolores Albarracin: and he can just put things on you

229
00:18:31.520 --> 00:18:32.839
Dolores Albarracin: to fix.

230
00:18:34.810 --> 00:18:35.630
Dolores Albarracin: Morgan.

231
00:18:38.190 --> 00:18:42.759
Morgan Potts: Just because I'm very. I'm somewhat familiar with this situation. How old is she?

232
00:18:44.560 --> 00:18:46.810
Patricia Renaud: Is she 30?

233
00:18:47.150 --> 00:18:48.639
Morgan Potts: Okay. And he is.

234
00:18:49.170 --> 00:18:51.170
Patricia Renaud: 36.

235
00:18:51.440 --> 00:18:52.010
Morgan Potts: Okay.

236
00:18:52.600 --> 00:18:56.549
Morgan Potts: just my humble opinion. She's got a lot of growing up to do.

237
00:18:56.960 --> 00:18:57.660
Patricia Renaud: Exactly.

238
00:18:57.660 --> 00:19:04.709
Morgan Potts: But also, but also y'all are gonna have to find some way of making this kismet, because y'all are stuck together forever. Honey.

239
00:19:05.340 --> 00:19:05.970
Patricia Renaud: Yeah.

240
00:19:07.340 --> 00:19:12.059
Morgan Potts: You don't have to love each other. You don't have to like each other, but

241
00:19:14.480 --> 00:19:15.870
Morgan Potts: I understand

242
00:19:15.890 --> 00:19:19.400
Morgan Potts: the mom deal. Trust me, I get it. But

243
00:19:19.560 --> 00:19:26.989
Morgan Potts: he's gonna have to make his own decisions and be able to see the light for himself before any change will ever happen.

244
00:19:28.920 --> 00:19:31.409
Morgan Potts: Anyway. That's my 2 cents in the jar.

245
00:19:32.630 --> 00:19:38.539
Dolores Albarracin: Yeah, what? What do you? What? What do you think of that, pat? How old are you? By the way.

246
00:19:38.750 --> 00:19:40.149
Patricia Renaud: Me. I'm 58.

247
00:19:40.150 --> 00:19:41.299
Dolores Albarracin: 58,

248
00:19:41.960 --> 00:19:46.070
Dolores Albarracin: so you could be taking a break from parenting.

249
00:19:48.120 --> 00:19:49.210
Patricia Renaud: Yeah.

250
00:19:49.210 --> 00:19:52.689
Dolores Albarracin: What would what would you do if you took a break.

251
00:19:53.670 --> 00:19:57.700
Patricia Renaud: I would probably be relaxing.

252
00:19:58.945 --> 00:19:59.550
Patricia Renaud: so.

253
00:20:00.960 --> 00:20:04.949
Dolores Albarracin: So have you thought of of what you would do exactly to

254
00:20:05.180 --> 00:20:09.729
Dolores Albarracin: just make yourself feel good, and forget about your son, and and his

255
00:20:09.920 --> 00:20:11.210
Dolores Albarracin: way of doing things.

256
00:20:11.210 --> 00:20:14.560
Patricia Renaud: Yeah, I'd probably do more of my own, you know.

257
00:20:15.140 --> 00:20:22.930
Patricia Renaud: interests and hobbies. I'm just looking out for their business, you know. My grandson's well-being.

258
00:20:25.020 --> 00:20:27.860
Dolores Albarracin: Yeah. But has it succeeded so far?

259
00:20:28.970 --> 00:20:33.589
Patricia Renaud: They bicker a lot between each other. So I'm trying to, you know, like.

260
00:20:34.940 --> 00:20:38.030
Patricia Renaud: that's what I worry about their emotional well-being

261
00:20:38.320 --> 00:20:41.370
Patricia Renaud: when the both of them are fighting over the money.

262
00:20:45.250 --> 00:20:49.053
Dolores Albarracin: So you've been. How long have you been involved in in this?

263
00:20:51.110 --> 00:20:54.329
Patricia Renaud: It's not, it's not constant, it's.

264
00:20:54.940 --> 00:20:55.550
Dolores Albarracin: But

265
00:20:55.900 --> 00:20:57.140
Dolores Albarracin: enough.

266
00:20:57.800 --> 00:21:00.380
Patricia Renaud: Enough to get on my nerves.

267
00:21:00.380 --> 00:21:03.209
Dolores Albarracin: To get on your nerves, but enough for you to.

268
00:21:03.710 --> 00:21:04.330
Dolores Albarracin: They.

269
00:21:04.330 --> 00:21:04.960
Patricia Renaud: Yes.

270
00:21:04.960 --> 00:21:08.010
Dolores Albarracin: Maybe I should just disengage from this.

271
00:21:08.010 --> 00:21:08.920
Patricia Renaud: Yeah.

272
00:21:09.500 --> 00:21:12.659
Patricia Renaud: It's hard in my, you know.

273
00:21:12.660 --> 00:21:15.740
Dolores Albarracin: What, hobby, what hobbies do you like.

274
00:21:16.340 --> 00:21:22.680
Patricia Renaud: I like to garden, cook everything I grow. I can for winter.

275
00:21:23.610 --> 00:21:25.770
Patricia Renaud: Just fishing out.

276
00:21:25.770 --> 00:21:26.250
Dolores Albarracin: I don't know.

277
00:21:26.250 --> 00:21:28.420
Patricia Renaud: Yeah. Spending out

278
00:21:28.770 --> 00:21:30.139
Patricia Renaud: time outside.

279
00:21:30.610 --> 00:21:40.800
Dolores Albarracin: So if you, if you were to make a plan for next week to just take care of you, Pat, not your son. What's your son's name?

280
00:21:41.150 --> 00:21:41.950
Patricia Renaud: Jared.

281
00:21:42.470 --> 00:21:43.360
Dolores Albarracin: Jared.

282
00:21:45.210 --> 00:21:46.034
Dolores Albarracin: Not

283
00:21:47.180 --> 00:21:53.549
Dolores Albarracin: having to worry about his life. What would you do in the next week? Which one of these.

284
00:21:53.550 --> 00:21:58.009
Patricia Renaud: Probably do some Christmas shopping and spend some time outside.

285
00:21:59.990 --> 00:22:03.540
Patricia Renaud: do a little cleaning before Christmas.

286
00:22:04.210 --> 00:22:07.180
Dolores Albarracin: And you think they would give you.

287
00:22:07.350 --> 00:22:08.980
Dolores Albarracin: Allow your time for that.

288
00:22:08.980 --> 00:22:10.126
Patricia Renaud: Oh, yeah.

289
00:22:17.120 --> 00:22:22.300
Dolores Albarracin: But it's not as interesting as this challenge. Perhaps.

290
00:22:25.350 --> 00:22:27.060
Dolores Albarracin: So much going on. Yeah.

291
00:22:27.060 --> 00:22:27.520
Patricia Renaud: Yeah.

292
00:22:27.520 --> 00:22:30.100
Dolores Albarracin: There are 4 kids, yeah.

293
00:22:30.600 --> 00:22:32.310
Dolores Albarracin: money issues.

294
00:22:33.010 --> 00:22:36.460
Dolores Albarracin: So how can you disengage from that.

295
00:22:38.030 --> 00:22:40.100
Patricia Renaud: Just leave him alone. I guess.

296
00:22:41.400 --> 00:22:41.900
Patricia Renaud: Like.

297
00:22:41.900 --> 00:22:43.900
Dolores Albarracin: A lot of Christmas shopping.

298
00:22:43.900 --> 00:22:44.355
Patricia Renaud: Yeah.

299
00:22:44.810 --> 00:22:45.400
Dolores Albarracin: Yeah.

300
00:22:46.430 --> 00:22:53.159
Dolores Albarracin: So could you set aside maybe a couple of hours, just for yourself in in the next week.

301
00:22:53.640 --> 00:22:55.499
Patricia Renaud: Yeah, I think so.

302
00:22:55.830 --> 00:22:58.919
Patricia Renaud: Between that and work I could probably

303
00:22:59.250 --> 00:23:00.750
Patricia Renaud: set aside time.

304
00:23:03.430 --> 00:23:04.819
Dolores Albarracin: When would that be?

305
00:23:05.972 --> 00:23:07.750
Patricia Renaud: Probably the weekend.

306
00:23:08.080 --> 00:23:12.420
Patricia Renaud: or after work. I work day shift so.

307
00:23:14.150 --> 00:23:17.290
Dolores Albarracin: So like Saturday or Sunday, perhaps.

308
00:23:17.290 --> 00:23:21.329
Patricia Renaud: Yeah, I do work some Saturdays, so Sunday would probably be the best.

309
00:23:21.330 --> 00:23:22.090
Dolores Albarracin: Day. No.

310
00:23:23.210 --> 00:23:28.250
Dolores Albarracin: because it would be nice if if you were able to do it, and and then

311
00:23:28.510 --> 00:23:39.960
Dolores Albarracin: come back and tell us how how it went like, are you able to really relax? Or are they? Are their issues still kind of going through your mind?

312
00:23:42.850 --> 00:23:44.090
Patricia Renaud: There are

313
00:23:44.760 --> 00:23:47.349
Patricia Renaud: you know, but something to work on

314
00:23:47.790 --> 00:23:49.579
Patricia Renaud: work in progress.

315
00:23:49.850 --> 00:23:52.909
Dolores Albarracin: So Sunday, and what would your

316
00:23:54.540 --> 00:23:55.830
Dolores Albarracin: husband

317
00:23:57.080 --> 00:23:58.020
Dolores Albarracin: think.

318
00:23:59.390 --> 00:24:05.579
Patricia Renaud: Probably the same thing, you know, just to get out and do things for you know ourselves.

319
00:24:05.580 --> 00:24:07.699
Dolores Albarracin: They would support this, yeah.

320
00:24:07.700 --> 00:24:08.310
Patricia Renaud: Definitely.

321
00:24:08.310 --> 00:24:12.029
Dolores Albarracin: Okay, well, yeah, I look forward to

322
00:24:12.100 --> 00:24:13.470
Dolores Albarracin: hearing about how.

323
00:24:14.160 --> 00:24:15.070
Dolores Albarracin: Oh!

324
00:24:15.445 --> 00:24:15.820
Patricia Renaud: Hey!

325
00:24:15.820 --> 00:24:16.490
Dolores Albarracin: And

326
00:24:16.860 --> 00:24:18.379
Dolores Albarracin: maybe you can

327
00:24:18.590 --> 00:24:23.560
Dolores Albarracin: actually achieve this of 2 h just for you.

328
00:24:23.910 --> 00:24:24.810
Patricia Renaud: Right.

329
00:24:26.070 --> 00:24:34.510
Dolores Albarracin: So how about somebody else on on the same question, something you would like to change in this case, it seems like Pat

330
00:24:34.730 --> 00:24:36.040
Dolores Albarracin: feels, been

331
00:24:36.450 --> 00:24:39.291
Dolores Albarracin: need some space more than

332
00:24:41.030 --> 00:24:46.919
Dolores Albarracin: repairing, because it may not be possible to make all the changes you would like.

333
00:24:46.970 --> 00:24:50.250
Dolores Albarracin: But how about others? Somebody else who.

334
00:24:50.250 --> 00:24:56.100
Michelle: I'm in the process. Go I'm in the process of expanding my network

335
00:24:56.230 --> 00:24:57.275
Michelle: and

336
00:24:59.270 --> 00:25:08.419
Michelle: I've joined a young professionals board for the special Olympics. And so I've met a lot of like like minded people through that

337
00:25:09.399 --> 00:25:21.530
Michelle: and it's given me something like we do events every month. So it's like given me something to force me to do which I've actually really enjoyed and found, like minded people.

338
00:25:24.090 --> 00:25:26.180
Dolores Albarracin: so you're doing well with this.

339
00:25:26.690 --> 00:25:33.219
Michelle: Yes, I was like I had a really hard time, because I was like, I'm not sure where my people are.

340
00:25:33.554 --> 00:25:39.600
Michelle: You know, like. I don't know where to find them. And I'm starting to find them. So that's kind of cool.

341
00:25:40.460 --> 00:25:43.600
Dolores Albarracin: That's great. Tell us more about how you found them.

342
00:25:44.766 --> 00:25:47.753
Michelle: I just found it online. One day.

343
00:25:48.430 --> 00:25:57.320
Michelle: I work with the autism community. And I saw that they were accepting applications for their board, and

344
00:25:58.180 --> 00:26:00.294
Michelle: I've always been

345
00:26:01.300 --> 00:26:06.270
Michelle: a volunteer. I've always volunteered. So this has been a different

346
00:26:06.770 --> 00:26:14.940
Michelle: aspect of it where it's like focused around social and building your network, which is like, really encouraged. And

347
00:26:16.400 --> 00:26:23.879
Michelle: it's it's cool now, finding a community and being like, Oh, my, gosh! How was I gonna do this without these people, before.

348
00:26:25.350 --> 00:26:29.030
Dolores Albarracin: And and through something you're very passionate about, too.

349
00:26:29.380 --> 00:26:30.200
Michelle: Exactly.

350
00:26:30.380 --> 00:26:41.490
Dolores Albarracin: Is there any change you would like to make to to any relationship or lack of relationships, or or too many, or anything like that?

351
00:26:42.517 --> 00:26:48.249
Michelle: I think that I have made a lot of changes. Kind of like protecting my peace

352
00:26:48.500 --> 00:26:51.309
Michelle: and making sure that

353
00:26:52.417 --> 00:26:54.979
Michelle: I have all of the like

354
00:26:55.360 --> 00:26:59.419
Michelle: tools necessary to deal with things without relying on somebody.

355
00:27:03.170 --> 00:27:06.529
Dolores Albarracin: So you don't have anything you like to change right now.

356
00:27:06.920 --> 00:27:09.100
Michelle: Not right now. I'm.

357
00:27:09.100 --> 00:27:09.670
Dolores Albarracin: Oh!

358
00:27:10.110 --> 00:27:16.860
Michelle: I'm besides building like my network, you know, I'm not looking for like personal relationships at the moment.

359
00:27:18.440 --> 00:27:20.579
Dolores Albarracin: And in the past, when you.

360
00:27:20.790 --> 00:27:25.170
Dolores Albarracin: when doing this, were you just at home? What were you doing.

361
00:27:26.216 --> 00:27:27.879
Michelle: What do you mean?

362
00:27:28.630 --> 00:27:29.130
Michelle: One.

363
00:27:29.130 --> 00:27:34.630
Dolores Albarracin: What were you doing during the time you're using now to to work for the board? When were you doing.

364
00:27:34.650 --> 00:27:38.445
Michelle: Oh, what was I doing back then? I was engaged.

365
00:27:38.900 --> 00:27:45.079
Michelle: and I was in a very serious, long-term relationship. And so I had a lot of extra free time.

366
00:27:47.570 --> 00:27:50.630
Dolores Albarracin: Okay, so lots of changes.

367
00:27:50.630 --> 00:27:51.430
Michelle: Oh, yeah.

368
00:27:51.430 --> 00:27:53.340
Dolores Albarracin: Good for you. It doesn't

369
00:27:53.690 --> 00:27:55.840
Dolores Albarracin: seem like you need to change anything.

370
00:27:55.840 --> 00:27:59.549
Michelle: Yes, and that's why I'm like I'm not changing anything else right now.

371
00:28:00.450 --> 00:28:05.960
Dolores Albarracin: But would you be willing to maybe help others, including maybe somebody in this group.

372
00:28:06.250 --> 00:28:08.950
Michelle: Yeah, absolutely. Absolutely.

373
00:28:10.790 --> 00:28:11.530
Dolores Albarracin: Great.

374
00:28:12.280 --> 00:28:17.250
Petra Teeter 237121: He's helping autism people. I have something to say about that, because

375
00:28:17.700 --> 00:28:23.319
Petra Teeter 237121: one of our sons has it. So I know what that means and how much

376
00:28:23.600 --> 00:28:25.239
Petra Teeter 237121: I'm going to call it work.

377
00:28:25.320 --> 00:28:29.177
Petra Teeter 237121: That is so. Here goes all my respect.

378
00:28:31.100 --> 00:28:32.000
Dolores Albarracin: Definitely.

379
00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:32.930
Michelle: Thank you. Thank you.

380
00:28:32.930 --> 00:28:35.180
Petra Teeter 237121: In itself is a full time job.

381
00:28:37.490 --> 00:28:42.100
Dolores Albarracin: So since you're talking, Petra, how about you?

382
00:28:42.720 --> 00:28:44.210
Dolores Albarracin: Is there

383
00:28:44.310 --> 00:28:49.280
Dolores Albarracin: anything that comes to mind? Maybe somebody you've lost contact with.

384
00:28:52.350 --> 00:28:54.890
Petra Teeter 237121: I would have to go back to my past.

385
00:28:54.990 --> 00:28:58.440
Petra Teeter 237121: Started out quite bumpy, starting with.

386
00:28:59.440 --> 00:29:03.909
Petra Teeter 237121: And let's just put it this way. I became the parent that

387
00:29:03.950 --> 00:29:05.550
Petra Teeter 237121: my parents weren't.

388
00:29:06.030 --> 00:29:08.059
Petra Teeter 237121: If that makes any sense

389
00:29:09.940 --> 00:29:10.560
Dolores Albarracin: Parents.

390
00:29:10.560 --> 00:29:11.619
Petra Teeter 237121: Moved out of my.

391
00:29:11.620 --> 00:29:15.930
Dolores Albarracin: Parent to your parents or parent to a sibling or.

392
00:29:15.930 --> 00:29:20.299
Petra Teeter 237121: No, I I myself became the parent to my son.

393
00:29:20.300 --> 00:29:21.199
Dolores Albarracin: 2 years son.

394
00:29:21.200 --> 00:29:23.870
Petra Teeter 237121: That my parents weren't ever to me.

395
00:29:24.230 --> 00:29:25.190
Dolores Albarracin: Okay.

396
00:29:25.190 --> 00:29:26.560
Petra Teeter 237121: I'm saying I have

397
00:29:27.260 --> 00:29:30.759
Petra Teeter 237121: not a good. I never had a good relationship with them.

398
00:29:33.020 --> 00:29:35.950
Petra Teeter 237121: So I moved out on my 18th birthday.

399
00:29:37.395 --> 00:29:38.460
Petra Teeter 237121: Had

400
00:29:39.830 --> 00:29:44.339
Petra Teeter 237121: too many relationships that didn't work out, and it was probably because

401
00:29:44.790 --> 00:29:45.659
Petra Teeter 237121: I just

402
00:29:45.890 --> 00:29:48.170
Petra Teeter 237121: wasn't ready for

403
00:29:48.830 --> 00:29:50.419
Petra Teeter 237121: anything like that.

404
00:29:51.510 --> 00:29:53.209
Petra Teeter 237121: Ended up.

405
00:29:54.960 --> 00:29:57.869
Petra Teeter 237121: Well, I moved out on my 18th birthday, and then.

406
00:29:58.200 --> 00:30:04.259
Petra Teeter 237121: by the age of 27, I had to make the decision to go to the Us.

407
00:30:05.316 --> 00:30:07.380
Petra Teeter 237121: I'm from Germany. Sorry

408
00:30:08.862 --> 00:30:09.860
Petra Teeter 237121: that makes sense.

409
00:30:10.467 --> 00:30:16.369
Petra Teeter 237121: and then, as I came here, the last thing I was looking for, I looked for change.

410
00:30:17.243 --> 00:30:25.480
Petra Teeter 237121: Just. It was a big change, I can tell you that. And I ended up actually running into my

411
00:30:25.630 --> 00:30:28.239
Petra Teeter 237121: husband that I'm still married to.

412
00:30:28.890 --> 00:30:33.420
Petra Teeter 237121: and I'm not suggesting that to anybody. But that's how it worked out.

413
00:30:34.004 --> 00:30:35.770
Petra Teeter 237121: There were people that I lost

414
00:30:36.860 --> 00:30:38.619
Petra Teeter 237121: during this entire

415
00:30:41.160 --> 00:30:43.782
Petra Teeter 237121: What should I call it? Oh,

416
00:30:44.520 --> 00:30:47.620
Petra Teeter 237121: disaster! And the

417
00:30:47.700 --> 00:30:49.529
Petra Teeter 237121: good part about

418
00:30:49.880 --> 00:30:57.789
Petra Teeter 237121: when you make big changes in your life, including maybe even moving away from places.

419
00:30:58.440 --> 00:31:05.009
Petra Teeter 237121: You are surprised to find out that you learn very quickly who was your real friend.

420
00:31:05.100 --> 00:31:07.010
Petra Teeter 237121: and who really cared about you

421
00:31:07.040 --> 00:31:08.089
Petra Teeter 237121: and who didn't.

422
00:31:08.270 --> 00:31:09.660
Petra Teeter 237121: and that's

423
00:31:10.170 --> 00:31:12.069
Petra Teeter 237121: a positive I took from that

424
00:31:13.600 --> 00:31:16.280
Petra Teeter 237121: other than that I ended up

425
00:31:17.178 --> 00:31:20.530
Petra Teeter 237121: but our son, our 2 sons.

426
00:31:21.810 --> 00:31:25.209
Petra Teeter 237121: my husband and I. We are very close.

427
00:31:26.100 --> 00:31:28.009
Petra Teeter 237121: and that's how I want to keep it.

428
00:31:29.110 --> 00:31:30.990
Dolores Albarracin: You don't want to.

429
00:31:30.990 --> 00:31:32.150
Petra Teeter 237121: Works, without that.

430
00:31:32.310 --> 00:31:38.940
Dolores Albarracin: You don't wanna make any changes to your life right now, like more friends, new people.

431
00:31:39.050 --> 00:31:40.460
Dolores Albarracin: Oh, congratulations!

432
00:31:40.460 --> 00:31:43.559
Petra Teeter 237121: I'm not saying I don't have any friends. I'm just saying

433
00:31:43.860 --> 00:31:45.429
Petra Teeter 237121: those are the

434
00:31:46.240 --> 00:31:49.400
Petra Teeter 237121: those under everything. So in

435
00:31:49.720 --> 00:31:51.559
Petra Teeter 237121: everyone else comes after that.

436
00:31:52.560 --> 00:31:55.319
Dolores Albarracin: And your parents? Are you in touch with them?

437
00:31:56.586 --> 00:32:01.359
Petra Teeter 237121: They're they're both no longer living. But

438
00:32:01.820 --> 00:32:05.419
Petra Teeter 237121: it's I. I was in touch with them when I had to.

439
00:32:05.460 --> 00:32:12.860
Petra Teeter 237121: but just being in touch with them, make me so miserable. My my husbands and sons always said like.

440
00:32:13.140 --> 00:32:16.929
Petra Teeter 237121: why is it they're your family? And I said, exactly.

441
00:32:16.930 --> 00:32:17.550
Morgan Potts: Currently.

442
00:32:17.810 --> 00:32:23.819
Petra Teeter 237121: It made me miserable to even talk to them over the phone. I hated it when they visited

443
00:32:24.846 --> 00:32:26.180
Petra Teeter 237121: they just

444
00:32:26.620 --> 00:32:27.700
Petra Teeter 237121: sometimes

445
00:32:28.280 --> 00:32:34.459
Petra Teeter 237121: I learned from that, and I find that sad. And again, that's why I became the parent. I didn't have.

446
00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:35.460
Dolores Albarracin: And so.

447
00:32:35.460 --> 00:32:39.790
Petra Teeter 237121: Sometimes you need to realize that even your own family

448
00:32:40.340 --> 00:32:44.759
Petra Teeter 237121: can just make your life miserable, and you need to find your own way.

449
00:32:44.890 --> 00:32:48.169
Petra Teeter 237121: It's a sad, sad thing, but it can be.

450
00:32:48.530 --> 00:32:49.380
Petra Teeter 237121: and.

451
00:32:49.731 --> 00:32:51.840
Dolores Albarracin: Very, very painful. How you describe

452
00:32:52.500 --> 00:33:01.670
Dolores Albarracin: was to even visit with your parents. Are you in touch with any any family members in Germany, who might have some insights.

453
00:33:02.899 --> 00:33:05.379
Petra Teeter 237121: I am in touch with with my sister.

454
00:33:05.380 --> 00:33:07.379
Dolores Albarracin: Or or what you went through.

455
00:33:08.010 --> 00:33:13.749
Petra Teeter 237121: Yes, I mean in touch with sister and her family and brother and his family.

456
00:33:13.780 --> 00:33:16.469
Petra Teeter 237121: It's not I have, you know.

457
00:33:16.760 --> 00:33:22.179
Petra Teeter 237121: I'm in touch with them. And they they weren't the problem they just couldn't help.

458
00:33:22.410 --> 00:33:24.449
Petra Teeter 237121: I had to find my own way.

459
00:33:25.070 --> 00:33:31.279
Petra Teeter 237121: And so that's where I came from. That's why I'm I'm happy

460
00:33:31.820 --> 00:33:36.554
Petra Teeter 237121: where I am as long as I have those 3 people in my life. And

461
00:33:37.020 --> 00:33:44.740
Petra Teeter 237121: And again, one of them has autism. So trust me. That's that's a lot of work.

462
00:33:44.940 --> 00:33:51.970
Petra Teeter 237121: and he actually appreciates it because he knows that the 3 of us always stand behind him.

463
00:33:52.440 --> 00:33:54.440
Petra Teeter 237121: And and then I'm also.

464
00:33:55.357 --> 00:34:05.439
Petra Teeter 237121: You know, I heard Patriot with Pat. I'm a very protective mother, and I am that because of the way I grew up, I guess.

465
00:34:05.440 --> 00:34:06.810
Dolores Albarracin: And pictures.

466
00:34:06.810 --> 00:34:10.759
Petra Teeter 237121: I need to stand back from my son and let them live their own life.

467
00:34:11.010 --> 00:34:13.860
Dolores Albarracin: So, Petro, you have 2 sons. Yes.

468
00:34:14.080 --> 00:34:15.219
Dolores Albarracin: one

469
00:34:15.929 --> 00:34:19.170
Dolores Albarracin: is out of the house, or both with you.

470
00:34:20.366 --> 00:34:27.319
Petra Teeter 237121: They're both kind of here and not really. They're both working, but they're also in the in the reserves.

471
00:34:28.239 --> 00:34:29.480
Petra Teeter 237121: the military reserve.

472
00:34:30.429 --> 00:34:31.379
Petra Teeter 237121: So there.

473
00:34:31.629 --> 00:34:33.299
Petra Teeter 237121: you know they're here

474
00:34:33.819 --> 00:34:36.194
Petra Teeter 237121: on, and well, they live here.

475
00:34:36.639 --> 00:34:40.199
Petra Teeter 237121: They're not. I'm saying they're not really here in the house a lot.

476
00:34:41.210 --> 00:34:47.289
Dolores Albarracin: What do people have to say about? I mean what Petra mentions about her.

477
00:34:48.020 --> 00:34:54.599
Dolores Albarracin: you know very difficult relationship with her parents, and and how she feels right now.

478
00:34:54.600 --> 00:35:10.899
Frank: I can relate. You know I get frustrated a lot of times when people tell me to. You know that I need to be in touch with my family, and that I need them in my life because they're family and my family is toxic. There's no reason for me to to

479
00:35:11.070 --> 00:35:21.010
Frank: be a part of their lives, and they've shunned me, and I'm I'm not welcome, so there's no there's no reason for me to be a part of it so I can relate.

480
00:35:24.460 --> 00:35:26.610
Morgan Potts: Just because they're your family does not

481
00:35:26.670 --> 00:35:29.439
Morgan Potts: make them automatically good human beings.

482
00:35:29.440 --> 00:35:30.640
Frank: Exactly.

483
00:35:31.430 --> 00:35:32.750
Patricia Renaud: Yep, I agree.

484
00:35:34.110 --> 00:35:35.750
Dolores Albarracin: So on a scale from 0.

485
00:35:36.130 --> 00:35:45.749
Dolores Albarracin: And Petra, would you say you're like at a 10 in terms of everything is is good in your relationships with others.

486
00:35:46.820 --> 00:35:47.720
Dolores Albarracin: Yes.

487
00:35:49.240 --> 00:35:54.170
Petra Teeter 237121: with with our sons and my husband. Yes, that's a 10.

488
00:35:55.986 --> 00:35:58.089
Dolores Albarracin: With others in general.

489
00:35:59.346 --> 00:36:01.580
Petra Teeter 237121: I I'm also I mean.

490
00:36:01.580 --> 00:36:02.080
Dolores Albarracin: Good.

491
00:36:02.080 --> 00:36:11.779
Petra Teeter 237121: Like, I said, my sister and and the whole family is in Germany. My brother and the whole family is in Germany. Let's put it this way. I may not go there all the time, because it's

492
00:36:12.070 --> 00:36:15.469
Petra Teeter 237121: expensive and time consuming. But

493
00:36:16.017 --> 00:36:24.599
Petra Teeter 237121: for example, my sons just went there a couple of months ago. Together. They they said, Mom, we really want to figure out where you came from.

494
00:36:24.640 --> 00:36:28.750
Petra Teeter 237121: which was kind of scary. But they went anyway. And

495
00:36:29.530 --> 00:36:41.110
Petra Teeter 237121: the 1st thing that I heard from my sister and my brother was, look if they need, if they are near where we live, and they need the place to stay. Please tell them they're welcome here.

496
00:36:41.350 --> 00:36:48.330
Petra Teeter 237121: And while our sons were also, you know, trying to do the whole experience with the

497
00:36:48.400 --> 00:36:50.890
Petra Teeter 237121: traveling by train through the

498
00:36:51.000 --> 00:37:03.069
Petra Teeter 237121: through Germany. They stop by my sister's house and my brother's house, and they're all their children who are also adults, because I'm way younger than my siblings.

499
00:37:03.941 --> 00:37:12.069
Petra Teeter 237121: They all came and visited, and and made an effort to meet our sons, so

500
00:37:12.170 --> 00:37:14.819
Petra Teeter 237121: I would say, the relationship is good. It is.

501
00:37:15.125 --> 00:37:15.430
Dolores Albarracin: Okay.

502
00:37:15.430 --> 00:37:17.830
Petra Teeter 237121: Not the option, but I think it's good.

503
00:37:17.830 --> 00:37:27.939
Dolores Albarracin: I will put you in the group of the potential helpers for others. Given that there is nothing you wanna improve in respect to relationship.

504
00:37:27.940 --> 00:37:33.030
Petra Teeter 237121: No, I have. I have permanent pain. So if you want something that I'm working on every day

505
00:37:33.060 --> 00:37:35.209
Petra Teeter 237121: there, there is your thing.

506
00:37:35.210 --> 00:37:36.050
Dolores Albarracin: Okay.

507
00:37:36.050 --> 00:37:36.919
Petra Teeter 237121: I mean it is.

508
00:37:36.920 --> 00:37:38.820
Dolores Albarracin: That will be next week.

509
00:37:39.590 --> 00:37:40.170
Petra Teeter 237121: Go.

510
00:37:40.170 --> 00:37:44.979
Dolores Albarracin: Sorry about that. But but at least you don't have to worry about

511
00:37:45.440 --> 00:37:47.390
Dolores Albarracin: relationships right now.

512
00:37:47.680 --> 00:37:48.730
Dolores Albarracin: Frank.

513
00:37:50.080 --> 00:37:55.159
Dolores Albarracin: you've been quite active, so I'd love to hear what this question

514
00:37:55.210 --> 00:37:56.820
Dolores Albarracin: brings up for you.

515
00:37:58.330 --> 00:38:03.450
Frank: Well, I have a lot of fractured relationships. I'm

516
00:38:04.080 --> 00:38:05.559
Frank: just coming

517
00:38:05.600 --> 00:38:11.919
Frank: out of being homeless for the, for I was homeless for 2 years in Colorado, and so I've

518
00:38:12.080 --> 00:38:15.129
Frank: been rehoused the last year and a half.

519
00:38:16.357 --> 00:38:19.500
Frank: So with my

520
00:38:19.700 --> 00:38:22.530
Frank: recovery and my, you know, just.

521
00:38:22.530 --> 00:38:25.029
Dolores Albarracin: Where? Where are you living now? Again.

522
00:38:25.630 --> 00:38:28.740
Frank: So I'm I live with my fiance in Ohio.

523
00:38:29.300 --> 00:38:32.160
Dolores Albarracin: So you've you've really rebuilt

524
00:38:32.420 --> 00:38:33.610
Dolores Albarracin: a lot.

525
00:38:34.050 --> 00:38:41.939
Frank: I have. Yeah. And the the person that I'm engaged to now was someone who had been in my life for 20 years

526
00:38:42.550 --> 00:38:48.779
Frank: and was kind of someone who was always there for me. It just it didn't turn romantic until

527
00:38:49.160 --> 00:38:50.610
Frank: recently, so

528
00:38:50.820 --> 00:39:08.000
Frank: she's just been, you know, somebody that was there for me, you know, from from the beginning we were friends 20 years ago, and have kind of kept in touch throughout, and she realized I was on the street and streets and not doing very well, and offered me a place to to stay.

529
00:39:08.130 --> 00:39:16.549
Frank: And I'm working on turning things around. It's taking time. I've got legal issues. I've got financial issues. I've got

530
00:39:16.960 --> 00:39:18.584
Frank: a lot of issues.

531
00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:21.100
Frank: so

532
00:39:21.110 --> 00:39:23.889
Frank: repairing all of that is taking a lot of work.

533
00:39:25.610 --> 00:39:30.369
Dolores Albarracin: I can't imagine. I mean, I think it's quite unbelievable. And you're

534
00:39:30.880 --> 00:39:35.049
Dolores Albarracin: not only now in a place, but also engaged and

535
00:39:36.710 --> 00:39:38.720
Dolores Albarracin: making all these changes.

536
00:39:39.240 --> 00:39:41.500
Morgan Potts: Congratulations, by the way.

537
00:39:41.500 --> 00:39:42.553
Frank: Thank you.

538
00:39:43.650 --> 00:39:52.980
Lewis: Very difficult process. You you. The main thing is, maintain your positivity. Don't look for it in other people. It's good that you have a main support person right there with you.

539
00:39:53.170 --> 00:40:03.690
Lewis: But as long as you stay positive, you gotta tackle those things individually. Don't look at it like all of this stuff is. All this stress is weighing me down because I'm in a similar situation.

540
00:40:04.100 --> 00:40:04.670
Frank: Yeah.

541
00:40:04.970 --> 00:40:08.569
Frank: yeah, it can be. It can be heavy, like weighing on me as far as like.

542
00:40:08.570 --> 00:40:08.980
Morgan Potts: No.

543
00:40:08.980 --> 00:40:11.850
Frank: All of the things that I have to do, and I have

544
00:40:13.360 --> 00:40:26.980
Frank: 2 dogs that I brought with me, that were there with me throughout all of my and they've they've been. I mean, they're a support as much as any any human has been. So

545
00:40:27.660 --> 00:40:28.690
Frank: yeah, right.

546
00:40:30.780 --> 00:40:31.600
Dolores Albarracin: And

547
00:40:31.860 --> 00:40:38.549
Dolores Albarracin: is there anything you would like to change right now with respect to any relationship.

548
00:40:38.750 --> 00:40:42.570
Dolores Albarracin: maybe reconnect with somebody, maybe connect less.

549
00:40:42.920 --> 00:40:43.410
Dolores Albarracin: maybe.

550
00:40:43.410 --> 00:40:43.850
Frank: Yeah.

551
00:40:43.850 --> 00:40:45.510
Dolores Albarracin: New activity.

552
00:40:46.060 --> 00:40:52.519
Frank: Yeah, I mean, I think, like, more like local sober activities. with with

553
00:40:52.740 --> 00:40:58.679
Frank: friends that are sober because all of my friends were addicts and

554
00:40:58.810 --> 00:41:04.929
Frank: my family. That's not an option for me to be in my family. I don't want to be a part of my family. There's some

555
00:41:05.680 --> 00:41:11.070
Frank: trauma there, that's not going to get fixed anytime soon. So

556
00:41:11.590 --> 00:41:13.299
Frank: I would like to

557
00:41:13.330 --> 00:41:22.600
Frank: have you know, friends that are my age that are that are sober like people that we can that I can hang out with. I spend a lot of time like

558
00:41:22.830 --> 00:41:23.790
Frank: in

559
00:41:24.399 --> 00:41:40.040
Frank: like group meetings, and like Ca, and na, and you know all the A's and a lot of stuff for my recovery, but as far as like just a buddy that I hang out with who's also sober, because that's kind of important where I'm at right now.

560
00:41:40.790 --> 00:41:42.430
Frank: would be nice.

561
00:41:42.430 --> 00:41:45.480
Dolores Albarracin: Very important for the rest of your life. Yeah.

562
00:41:45.480 --> 00:41:46.010
Frank: Yeah.

563
00:41:46.010 --> 00:41:49.429
Dolores Albarracin: And you're not originally from Ohio.

564
00:41:49.700 --> 00:41:51.439
Frank: No, I'm from New Orleans.

565
00:41:52.330 --> 00:41:53.320
Dolores Albarracin: So

566
00:41:53.890 --> 00:42:01.530
Dolores Albarracin: do you have any? I mean, are you on social media? Do you have any friends on Facebook? Maybe from the past.

567
00:42:01.980 --> 00:42:03.060
Frank: I have some

568
00:42:03.650 --> 00:42:06.609
Frank: friends like online. I'm

569
00:42:06.840 --> 00:42:09.799
Frank: I have a blog, and I kind of

570
00:42:11.830 --> 00:42:20.530
Frank: you know, reach people that way. But also, you know, I'm I'm active on things like Reddit, and but these aren't people that I know like.

571
00:42:21.066 --> 00:42:21.660
Morgan Potts: Of course.

572
00:42:22.510 --> 00:42:23.140
Frank: Yeah.

573
00:42:23.140 --> 00:42:24.570
Dolores Albarracin: So like your

574
00:42:24.620 --> 00:42:30.609
Dolores Albarracin: high school friends who might be hanging out online. Do do you have any of those.

575
00:42:32.090 --> 00:42:33.890
Frank: No, my!

576
00:42:34.820 --> 00:42:42.120
Frank: My childhood is a long story, and I went to 4 different high schools, and

577
00:42:42.370 --> 00:42:48.890
Frank: I don't have any long-term relationships from when I was a kid, and I started using drugs from a very young age and

578
00:42:49.955 --> 00:42:50.910
Frank: so

579
00:42:52.370 --> 00:42:55.730
Frank: I don't have any long term relationships.

580
00:42:56.570 --> 00:42:57.390
Dolores Albarracin: And

581
00:42:58.160 --> 00:42:59.115
Dolores Albarracin: any

582
00:43:00.420 --> 00:43:05.479
Dolores Albarracin: I don't know where you are in Ohio, if it's a very small place, but are there any.

583
00:43:05.920 --> 00:43:06.640
Patricia Renaud: Perhaps.

584
00:43:06.640 --> 00:43:13.180
Dolores Albarracin: Groups to look into like do you have any hobbies, or what? What are your interests?

585
00:43:13.180 --> 00:43:15.920
Frank: Yeah, I mean, I've looked into some, some.

586
00:43:15.990 --> 00:43:27.759
Frank: some like social groups, for like you know, people who are just like in there, you know, around my age that are looking for for friends or but it.

587
00:43:28.230 --> 00:43:47.029
Frank: the problem is, is trying to find people who are sober, because if if I'm hanging out with someone who's drinking, that's still going to be a problem for me, and they may not have an issue with alcohol at all, and that's their prerogative. But I can't handle being around that at this point in my sobriety.

588
00:43:48.443 --> 00:43:48.870
Frank: So.

589
00:43:49.452 --> 00:43:54.107
Dolores Albarracin: Something like walking or-, or some type of

590
00:43:54.690 --> 00:44:03.436
Frank: It'd be cool to meet like somebody who's into you know who has dogs who could play with, you know. Hang out with my dogs and

591
00:44:03.850 --> 00:44:05.889
Frank: share an interest that way.

592
00:44:06.150 --> 00:44:06.889
Frank: A lot of.

593
00:44:06.890 --> 00:44:09.240
Dolores Albarracin: People are nodding, dodging.

594
00:44:09.240 --> 00:44:11.929
Morgan Potts: Best dogs are the absolute best.

595
00:44:12.040 --> 00:44:12.860
Morgan Potts: Yeah.

596
00:44:12.860 --> 00:44:15.690
Dolores Albarracin: Lou, do you have ideas for, Frank?

597
00:44:16.890 --> 00:44:21.769
Dolores Albarracin: Of what? What? That could be, that activity where he could meet people who are not.

598
00:44:21.770 --> 00:44:22.450
Lewis: I know.

599
00:44:22.700 --> 00:44:40.420
Lewis: Well, yeah, a lot of what you suggested, like the, you know, finding a local dog park and kind of hanging out there, and you might end up running into somebody that has the same breed as your dog. Or you know it's not that you want to force those type of conversations and interactions. But you, you kind of put yourself in a position that it could happen.

600
00:44:40.620 --> 00:44:48.379
Lewis: you know. So it's it's it's a, it's a building pro process, because I know, like you were saying, you don't want to risk

601
00:44:48.390 --> 00:44:53.770
Lewis: your sobriety by being around people that may not understand it, or actually comfortable

602
00:44:53.800 --> 00:44:56.280
Lewis: with the other side of it. I understand that part

603
00:44:56.320 --> 00:45:01.319
Lewis: because I've hung around a lot of people that where it's not necessarily negative.

604
00:45:01.460 --> 00:45:04.469
Lewis: but it isn't necessarily positive either.

605
00:45:04.470 --> 00:45:18.120
Frank: Yeah. And another thing is that being for me, I'm I'm a trans. Man, and for my safety is important as well. So if I'm I've had some really

606
00:45:18.670 --> 00:45:22.810
Frank: violent experiences with men. And

607
00:45:23.260 --> 00:45:24.250
Frank: so.

608
00:45:25.140 --> 00:45:33.439
Frank: you know, it's important that I'm able to be myself without feeling like I'm going to be attacked, or I'm going to, you know. Be put in a dangerous situation.

609
00:45:34.260 --> 00:45:41.579
Dolores Albarracin: So an LGBT group that gets together for some sport, maybe.

610
00:45:41.580 --> 00:45:41.930
Frank: Yeah.

611
00:45:41.930 --> 00:45:43.870
Dolores Albarracin: Walks, hikes.

612
00:45:44.350 --> 00:45:45.010
Frank: Yeah.

613
00:45:46.400 --> 00:45:48.589
Dolores Albarracin: Have you ever found anything like that.

614
00:45:51.760 --> 00:45:52.500
Frank: I

615
00:45:52.880 --> 00:45:58.960
Frank: here and there. I really haven't. I haven't looked. I've had so many things going on with my

616
00:45:59.530 --> 00:46:05.470
Frank: with my recovery and with. I've had a lot of health issues since then and

617
00:46:05.670 --> 00:46:08.570
Frank: getting my my life back on track that I haven't really

618
00:46:08.930 --> 00:46:15.709
Frank: focused on my social interactions much. And I think that's a area of my life that I've neglected.

619
00:46:16.770 --> 00:46:25.509
Dolores Albarracin: So, would you? Do you think you'd you'd be interested in perhaps just doing a survey of what might be out there.

620
00:46:25.510 --> 00:46:26.480
Frank: Yeah.

621
00:46:26.480 --> 00:46:27.569
Dolores Albarracin: For next week.

622
00:46:28.320 --> 00:46:30.090
Frank: Yeah, yeah, I mean, I could do that.

623
00:46:31.040 --> 00:46:32.320
Dolores Albarracin: Where would you look?

624
00:46:32.640 --> 00:46:33.810
Frank: I think

625
00:46:35.820 --> 00:46:37.603
Frank: think that there's an app

626
00:46:40.930 --> 00:46:42.580
Morgan Potts: Door, or.

627
00:46:42.580 --> 00:46:44.510
Frank: Well, not next door. There's another.

628
00:46:45.005 --> 00:46:45.500
Michelle: Know.

629
00:46:45.780 --> 00:46:47.230
Frank: Meet up. Yeah. Meet up.

630
00:46:47.230 --> 00:46:48.270
Morgan Potts: Yeah, that's it.

631
00:46:48.550 --> 00:47:01.939
Frank: Meet up is a good group. I used to hang out with people that like to watch horror films together because I'm into that. And I found a good group on Meetup that did that. So? I think Meetup might be a good spot.

632
00:47:02.470 --> 00:47:04.280
Patricia Renaud: Could always start your own group.

633
00:47:04.550 --> 00:47:05.220
Frank: Yeah.

634
00:47:08.280 --> 00:47:13.030
Dolores Albarracin: If you were to start your own group, what would it be about, dog? It seems.

635
00:47:13.389 --> 00:47:16.981
Frank: It might be it might be about dogs. It might.

636
00:47:18.772 --> 00:47:20.460
Frank: it. It might be

637
00:47:20.500 --> 00:47:27.540
Frank: a horror. Genre kind of group science fiction.

638
00:47:29.230 --> 00:47:34.170
Frank: Board games. I like to play board games. There's a lot of things I like to do.

639
00:47:35.350 --> 00:47:39.259
Morgan Potts: I'm a crazy dog, lady. What breed of dogs do you have.

640
00:47:39.260 --> 00:47:40.949
Frank: I have 2 Boston terriers.

641
00:47:40.950 --> 00:47:41.960
Morgan Potts: Oh.

642
00:47:43.020 --> 00:47:43.770
Morgan Potts: okay.

643
00:47:44.950 --> 00:47:46.119
Morgan Potts: little bug, ass.

644
00:47:47.435 --> 00:47:55.839
Dolores Albarracin: Yeah, I'd love to to hear what you come up with in terms of like a list of what might be out there.

645
00:47:55.840 --> 00:47:57.629
Frank: Sure. Yeah, I can do that.

646
00:47:58.050 --> 00:48:01.259
Dolores Albarracin: By Tuesday, can you tell us?

647
00:48:01.580 --> 00:48:03.030
Dolores Albarracin: And then went.

648
00:48:03.030 --> 00:48:04.500
Frank: Some homework.

649
00:48:04.960 --> 00:48:05.990
Dolores Albarracin: Homework.

650
00:48:06.680 --> 00:48:12.650
Dolores Albarracin: Yeah. So, Lou, well, let me ask Crystal Crystal. I cannot see you.

651
00:48:12.960 --> 00:48:16.200
Dolores Albarracin: Would you turn on your camera so we can see you.

652
00:48:17.310 --> 00:48:20.930
Dolores Albarracin: and then we we've only introduced

653
00:48:21.380 --> 00:48:29.620
Dolores Albarracin: each of us. You've been seeing some, some of us, so we probably don't want to do a whole round, but if you can tell us

654
00:48:30.530 --> 00:48:33.770
Dolores Albarracin: which state you're in. Can you hear me, Crystal?

655
00:48:34.130 --> 00:48:39.689
Dolores Albarracin: You have to unmute yourself. The unmute button is on. Yeah, that one.

656
00:48:39.910 --> 00:48:40.800
Dolores Albarracin: Yes.

657
00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:47.849
Dolores Albarracin: I should be able to hear you. Now, what what state are you calling from? Crystal?

658
00:48:56.750 --> 00:48:57.150
Dolores Albarracin: Hello!

659
00:48:57.150 --> 00:48:57.720
Krystal: Up.

660
00:48:59.040 --> 00:49:00.279
Krystal: Oh, I'm in Michigan.

661
00:49:01.060 --> 00:49:01.850
Dolores Albarracin: Michigan.

662
00:49:02.640 --> 00:49:04.539
Dolores Albarracin: and can you turn on your

663
00:49:14.650 --> 00:49:15.440
Dolores Albarracin: so.

664
00:49:16.090 --> 00:49:17.369
Lewis: Could be Spotty Wi-fi.

665
00:49:17.370 --> 00:49:25.259
Dolores Albarracin: Yeah, yeah. The video icon is right. Next to the audio icon on on the bottom left.

666
00:49:27.460 --> 00:49:29.119
Dolores Albarracin: If you can find that.

667
00:49:29.830 --> 00:49:33.560
Frank: If her Wi-fi connection is bad, she might not be able to get video to turn on.

668
00:49:33.860 --> 00:49:34.450
Morgan Potts: M.

669
00:49:35.290 --> 00:49:37.339
Morgan Potts: And she may not hear you at all either.

670
00:49:37.340 --> 00:49:38.060
Dolores Albarracin: Yeah.

671
00:49:39.110 --> 00:49:41.639
Dolores Albarracin: I don't know what's going on so

672
00:49:42.210 --> 00:49:47.680
Dolores Albarracin: well, then, let's let's let's see about others.

673
00:49:47.680 --> 00:49:48.040
Krystal: Oh!

674
00:49:49.590 --> 00:49:50.249
Morgan Potts: Yeah, I'll go

675
00:49:53.110 --> 00:49:54.170
Morgan Potts: oops. She's trying.

676
00:49:54.170 --> 00:49:56.240
Dolores Albarracin: Crystal. Try again.

677
00:50:01.110 --> 00:50:04.840
Dolores Albarracin: Yeah, you're calling from Michigan Crystal.

678
00:50:05.200 --> 00:50:06.849
Dolores Albarracin: Who do you live with.

679
00:50:10.100 --> 00:50:12.080
Morgan Potts: We lost her again. Yeah.

680
00:50:13.400 --> 00:50:16.659
Dolores Albarracin: All right. Go back to Morgan. Morgan.

681
00:50:17.484 --> 00:50:18.392
Morgan Potts: Yes, so

682
00:50:20.040 --> 00:50:31.090
Morgan Potts: 1st I apologize for this very annoying cough I can't seem to get rid of, so after I'm done. If you want to mute me for the benefit of everybody else. That's fine.

683
00:50:31.760 --> 00:50:33.210
Dolores Albarracin: I have not heard.

684
00:50:33.420 --> 00:50:35.400
Dolores Albarracin: and he'd be coughing so.

685
00:50:35.400 --> 00:50:38.181
Morgan Potts: Good, thank God! Because I thought that I was

686
00:50:39.660 --> 00:50:47.280
Morgan Potts: So I would like to reconnect with someone who was someone that I considered a best friend

687
00:50:48.570 --> 00:50:57.409
Morgan Potts: who I met through work, and it's very funny how we met, but I won't digress into that and I'm not.

688
00:50:59.560 --> 00:51:08.040
Morgan Potts: We lived in the same town. I met her organically through work, and immediately we were just like just buddies, and

689
00:51:08.120 --> 00:51:10.000
Morgan Potts: her husband

690
00:51:10.120 --> 00:51:13.929
Morgan Potts: was in the service. He was in the Air Force

691
00:51:14.650 --> 00:51:18.339
Morgan Potts: the entire time they were married. So

692
00:51:18.360 --> 00:51:25.330
Morgan Potts: it's a very odd. It was a very odd situation, and I respect them completely. But she pretty much lived alone.

693
00:51:25.840 --> 00:51:28.299
Morgan Potts: and he lived in states away.

694
00:51:28.440 --> 00:51:31.649
Morgan Potts: and they had a big

695
00:51:31.940 --> 00:51:38.739
Morgan Potts: falling out in their marriage, and they managed to work it out well. She moved across the country to the State of Washington.

696
00:51:38.740 --> 00:51:41.037
Dolores Albarracin: What's her? What's her 1st name?

697
00:51:41.640 --> 00:51:42.480
Morgan Potts: Emily.

698
00:51:42.480 --> 00:51:43.260
Dolores Albarracin: Emily.

699
00:51:44.495 --> 00:51:50.149
Morgan Potts: She used to live right around the corner when they had a huge

700
00:51:50.980 --> 00:51:55.080
Morgan Potts: kerfluffle, and I'll just spill the tea he was cheating on her.

701
00:51:58.010 --> 00:51:59.100
Morgan Potts: I

702
00:51:59.230 --> 00:52:02.529
Morgan Potts: was there for her incredibly a lot.

703
00:52:02.910 --> 00:52:17.060
Morgan Potts: He! They decided that they want to work this out. Forgive everything. And she packed her stuff from North Carolina, and drove all the way to Washington State with 2 dogs, a turtle, and a goldfish, and moving boys.

704
00:52:17.260 --> 00:52:17.750
Dolores Albarracin: Oh!

705
00:52:19.400 --> 00:52:20.310
Morgan Potts: so

706
00:52:21.570 --> 00:52:22.960
Morgan Potts: ever since

707
00:52:23.250 --> 00:52:24.840
Morgan Potts: he moved back.

708
00:52:25.910 --> 00:52:28.090
Morgan Potts: He is so

709
00:52:28.280 --> 00:52:32.949
Morgan Potts: he he's all consumed with him and him, and I understand

710
00:52:33.290 --> 00:52:39.019
Morgan Potts: the why. But I kind of thought that, like honeymoon crap would have fizzled out by now.

711
00:52:39.450 --> 00:52:40.590
Morgan Potts: But

712
00:52:42.150 --> 00:52:44.769
Morgan Potts: He's been moved away for

713
00:52:45.180 --> 00:52:46.860
Morgan Potts: 2 or 3 years.

714
00:52:47.140 --> 00:52:50.759
Morgan Potts: We used to talk text every single day.

715
00:52:51.670 --> 00:52:52.890
Morgan Potts: I don't hear from her.

716
00:52:53.300 --> 00:52:59.869
Morgan Potts: I might send her a text like some funny little name I saw about dogs because we're both crazy dog, ladies

717
00:53:00.770 --> 00:53:03.580
Morgan Potts: and I might just get like a emoji back.

718
00:53:04.080 --> 00:53:07.840
Morgan Potts: and I would like to reconnect that.

719
00:53:09.074 --> 00:53:12.949
Morgan Potts: I think part of the reason why we

720
00:53:14.480 --> 00:53:22.710
Morgan Potts: got very distant, not only the physical distance, and not only because she became all consuming with her husband and all that jazz

721
00:53:24.250 --> 00:53:27.270
Morgan Potts: part of why I'm doing this is because

722
00:53:27.910 --> 00:53:33.230
Morgan Potts: my little sister died like 7 years ago, from a heroin overdose and

723
00:53:34.760 --> 00:53:37.589
Morgan Potts: After that I went into a very bad spot.

724
00:53:39.440 --> 00:53:45.060
Morgan Potts: I was drinking an excessive amount, because I just wanted to be numb and not care.

725
00:53:47.090 --> 00:53:48.030
Morgan Potts: Me and her used to.

726
00:53:48.030 --> 00:53:49.960
Dolores Albarracin: How old was your sister?

727
00:53:49.960 --> 00:53:51.200
Morgan Potts: He was 27.

728
00:53:53.580 --> 00:53:54.510
Morgan Potts: sorry

729
00:53:54.630 --> 00:53:58.959
Morgan Potts: so. But me and Emily we used to get together. Have a good time.

730
00:53:59.280 --> 00:54:02.489
Morgan Potts: And all of a sudden. One day she just

731
00:54:02.930 --> 00:54:09.019
Morgan Potts: decided, that's not for her anymore, and that's fine. But she became very condescending.

732
00:54:10.490 --> 00:54:11.730
Morgan Potts: And

733
00:54:12.980 --> 00:54:13.670
Morgan Potts: I

734
00:54:14.950 --> 00:54:16.870
Morgan Potts: I'm not here for your judgment.

735
00:54:17.070 --> 00:54:25.690
Morgan Potts: I mean if you're my friend and you're concerned, that's fine, you can be concerned. But I don't need you to preach at me when you were in the same boat with me not very long ago.

736
00:54:26.524 --> 00:54:31.539
Morgan Potts: except for the fact that my sister died. Your husband was cheating on you, but

737
00:54:32.230 --> 00:54:34.179
Morgan Potts: I would like to reconnect that

738
00:54:34.390 --> 00:54:40.800
Morgan Potts: I have some efforts to do that, but I will also say that the phone works the 2 ways.

739
00:54:42.970 --> 00:54:44.769
Lewis: If I can interject.

740
00:54:44.930 --> 00:54:46.499
Dolores Albarracin: Go ahead. Yes, please. Lou.

741
00:54:46.500 --> 00:54:51.959
Lewis: I would say that I've been in situations with friends and family

742
00:54:52.090 --> 00:54:53.370
Lewis: where

743
00:54:53.670 --> 00:54:55.330
Lewis: they're in a relationship.

744
00:54:55.520 --> 00:55:00.599
Lewis: and then when they have their issues, if you are in support of that person.

745
00:55:01.080 --> 00:55:06.899
Lewis: and more of them, you know, being themselves again, getting, you know, having an individual life

746
00:55:07.000 --> 00:55:15.189
Lewis: separate from the relationship a lot of times they can end up going back and still telling that significant other what you've been saying.

747
00:55:15.560 --> 00:55:18.410
Lewis: And then it kind of causes a rift in the fact that.

748
00:55:18.410 --> 00:55:20.180
Morgan Potts: Oh no!

749
00:55:20.180 --> 00:55:27.669
Lewis: She kind of. She kind of recommits to him, and then he kind of makes sure that you're not as much of a friend as you were.

750
00:55:27.850 --> 00:55:28.370
Morgan Potts: Did.

751
00:55:28.370 --> 00:55:33.560
Lewis: And I only got that from. I only got that from you, saying she moved all the way across the country.

752
00:55:33.900 --> 00:55:38.150
Lewis: and then she doesn't speak to you that much. You always have to be the person to initiate.

753
00:55:38.160 --> 00:55:44.550
Lewis: I've been in that situation myself where it was like I didn't input too much, but I was just like, Hey, you know, she's kind of using you.

754
00:55:44.810 --> 00:55:54.220
Lewis: I don't know how much longer you can deal with it, but I can see she's using you. I'm sure your family's told you that. And then I want to say 2, 3 weeks from there.

755
00:55:54.360 --> 00:56:05.730
Lewis: Never heard from that person again, who I considered a good friend. So I've I've kind of dealt with that situation, not saying that it is that same situation, but kind of hearing from what you were saying that I've

756
00:56:06.190 --> 00:56:08.619
Lewis: I've kind of seen that before.

757
00:56:08.620 --> 00:56:17.389
Morgan Potts: I think that you're very much on point with that. Now that I can look back, and I can see it from that different perspective. The light bulb just clicked on. And I'm like.

758
00:56:18.130 --> 00:56:21.470
Morgan Potts: he probably doesn't want me talking to her anymore.

759
00:56:22.100 --> 00:56:22.880
Morgan Potts: So

760
00:56:23.490 --> 00:56:24.979
Morgan Potts: there's that. Thank you.

761
00:56:25.440 --> 00:56:31.659
Dolores Albarracin: It. It does sound a little bit like Pat's situation. Yeah, when you're trying to.

762
00:56:31.700 --> 00:56:32.740
Dolores Albarracin: Tuned.

763
00:56:32.860 --> 00:56:42.579
Dolores Albarracin: introduce changes. But you really cannot. Yeah. Because she went back. And she, you know, she'll make her own decisions.

764
00:56:42.820 --> 00:56:43.160
Morgan Potts: Yeah.

765
00:56:43.160 --> 00:56:46.744
Dolores Albarracin: Do you miss her, or do you wanna tell her something?

766
00:56:47.070 --> 00:57:04.210
Morgan Potts: Oh, I miss her incredibly. We used to have the stupidest inside jokes on the planet that nobody else would ever get, but it would make us cackle like hyenas, and I miss my friend, and I miss the friend that had the funniest, snarkiest little comments that would make you just

767
00:57:04.880 --> 00:57:10.690
Morgan Potts: like, what did you just say? But she has just become this very

768
00:57:11.770 --> 00:57:22.399
Morgan Potts: condescending human being that I no longer recognize. And I want to believe that the Og Emily is down in there somewhere, but

769
00:57:22.730 --> 00:57:26.109
Morgan Potts: if she's just gonna be a clone of her

770
00:57:26.580 --> 00:57:29.240
Morgan Potts: husband, who I don't much care for.

771
00:57:30.140 --> 00:57:31.200
Morgan Potts: then

772
00:57:31.270 --> 00:57:34.330
Morgan Potts: I can just say I tried, and I can walk away.

773
00:57:35.880 --> 00:57:38.599
Dolores Albarracin: So it sounds like

774
00:57:38.660 --> 00:57:41.189
Dolores Albarracin: she's not gonna be the fun friend.

775
00:57:41.600 --> 00:57:43.809
Dolores Albarracin: Then you missed. Yeah.

776
00:57:43.810 --> 00:57:57.480
Morgan Potts: I'm trying to give her the benefit of the doubt. So check this. They moved back from Washington State to Pennsylvania, so we packed up the goldfish and the 2 dogs and the turtle. Again we moved them to Pennsylvania.

777
00:57:58.420 --> 00:58:01.439
Morgan Potts: back where her family and his family are from.

778
00:58:01.550 --> 00:58:09.269
Morgan Potts: so I'm hoping that that familial bond will maybe ground them a little bit.

779
00:58:09.270 --> 00:58:14.569
Dolores Albarracin: Yeah, but it's not some, not your problem, in a way. Yeah.

780
00:58:14.800 --> 00:58:15.295
Morgan Potts: Well.

781
00:58:16.450 --> 00:58:17.880
Morgan Potts: he.

782
00:58:18.510 --> 00:58:30.819
Morgan Potts: the phone works both ways. I have really, truly made a effort to bridge the gap, and if she doesn't want to re-bridge it, and I'm kind of getting the hint like Louis said Wink, wink that

783
00:58:30.940 --> 00:58:33.220
Morgan Potts: maybe that bridge won't be mended.

784
00:58:33.420 --> 00:58:34.210
Morgan Potts: Okay.

785
00:58:35.920 --> 00:58:40.389
Dolores Albarracin: Maybe a nice Christmas card, and and that's all you can do.

786
00:58:40.440 --> 00:58:43.169
Morgan Potts: I think that's a very good idea. And I think I'm gonna write that down.

787
00:58:45.290 --> 00:58:47.049
Dolores Albarracin: In the meantime.

788
00:58:47.220 --> 00:58:52.789
Dolores Albarracin: how about finding other people who could be fun or.

789
00:58:52.790 --> 00:58:54.070
Morgan Potts: Oh, yeah, how many?

790
00:58:54.070 --> 00:58:55.590
Dolores Albarracin: Hub, or.

791
00:58:56.870 --> 00:58:58.339
Morgan Potts: I've met and I've met.

792
00:58:58.340 --> 00:59:02.590
Dolores Albarracin: His comedies. I don't know if you like to laugh.

793
00:59:03.060 --> 00:59:09.469
Morgan Potts: Oh, yeah, I mean, I've made new friends. Yeah, it's just you know, you miss the friend that you used to have. That was

794
00:59:11.500 --> 00:59:17.290
Morgan Potts: your your dude or your girl. You just miss that person that you used to laugh about the silliest stuff with.

795
00:59:17.310 --> 00:59:19.435
Morgan Potts: But I've made new friends.

796
00:59:20.090 --> 00:59:21.219
Morgan Potts: I moved

797
00:59:21.420 --> 00:59:24.910
Morgan Potts: recent. Well, a year ago I made new friends.

798
00:59:25.530 --> 00:59:26.950
Morgan Potts: So I'm okay.

799
00:59:26.950 --> 00:59:28.999
Dolores Albarracin: So new friends where you are now.

800
00:59:29.000 --> 00:59:29.740
Morgan Potts: Yes, ma'am.

801
00:59:33.450 --> 00:59:35.730
Dolores Albarracin: Excellent. So maybe a card.

802
00:59:36.000 --> 00:59:36.700
Morgan Potts: I just.

803
00:59:38.710 --> 00:59:43.219
Morgan Potts: I just wrote that down. That's exactly what I'm going to do. It's going to be the prettiest one I can find.

804
00:59:44.460 --> 00:59:46.959
Dolores Albarracin: That's very nice of you. Yeah.

805
00:59:46.960 --> 00:59:47.480
Morgan Potts: The idea.

806
00:59:47.480 --> 00:59:49.170
Dolores Albarracin: Very good friend.

807
00:59:50.590 --> 00:59:52.569
Dolores Albarracin: so tell us how it goes.

808
00:59:53.320 --> 00:59:56.199
Morgan Potts: Thank you very much for the idea. I hadn't thought about that.

809
00:59:58.110 --> 01:00:05.819
Dolores Albarracin: So Crystal is trying to come back. We'll see if her Internet improves. So, John, you've been very quiet.

810
01:00:06.545 --> 01:00:08.320
john bianculli: Can you hear me now?

811
01:00:08.320 --> 01:00:11.180
Dolores Albarracin: Yes, yes, I can hear you very well.

812
01:00:12.123 --> 01:00:19.230
john bianculli: Very good. Yeah, for me. I'm starting to work on my aftercare, trying to make sure I have a good support network to come home to

813
01:00:20.530 --> 01:00:25.450
john bianculli: unfortunately need to weed out who I need to keep as a friend who might be harmful.

814
01:00:25.760 --> 01:00:29.900
john bianculli: So that's what I'm facing, right. I'm kind of doing that right now.

815
01:00:29.900 --> 01:00:32.330
Dolores Albarracin: Tell. Tell me more about that, and tell him.

816
01:00:33.070 --> 01:00:35.920
john bianculli: Well, I mean trying to sort out.

817
01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:37.473
john bianculli: make connections.

818
01:00:38.590 --> 01:00:41.050
john bianculli: are you familiar with the Aa. Steps.

819
01:00:42.650 --> 01:00:45.500
john bianculli: I'm doing kind of 8 and 9

820
01:00:46.480 --> 01:00:47.470
john bianculli: like doing these.

821
01:00:47.470 --> 01:00:50.470
Dolores Albarracin: Remember what they are, but making amends. One of those.

822
01:00:50.470 --> 01:00:51.760
john bianculli: Yeah, yeah, making amends.

823
01:00:51.760 --> 01:00:52.230
Dolores Albarracin: Okay.

824
01:00:52.230 --> 01:00:54.879
john bianculli: So I mean, yeah, unfortunately, then, I

825
01:00:54.910 --> 01:00:59.230
john bianculli: so. But that's what I'm trying to do. Figure out who I need to make amends to.

826
01:00:59.280 --> 01:01:00.410
john bianculli: who I don't.

827
01:01:00.500 --> 01:01:03.159
john bianculli: who might cause me to relapse.

828
01:01:03.560 --> 01:01:07.439
john bianculli: Those are all things I have to consider. Whenever I'm trying to reach out to people.

829
01:01:08.100 --> 01:01:11.010
Dolores Albarracin: Do you come up with a list, or how do you do that?

830
01:01:11.213 --> 01:01:12.230
john bianculli: Yeah, I have a list.

831
01:01:13.310 --> 01:01:15.280
john bianculli: So I mean, I have.

832
01:01:16.360 --> 01:01:20.089
john bianculli: I would say out of, I used to have like 15 people that

833
01:01:21.290 --> 01:01:23.920
john bianculli: we're kind of like my inner Circle friends.

834
01:01:25.110 --> 01:01:29.919
john bianculli: I had 2 relapses after the second one that got knocked down to about 3 people.

835
01:01:30.870 --> 01:01:34.800
john bianculli: but so I still have my 3 core friends. I'm kind of

836
01:01:34.850 --> 01:01:39.530
john bianculli: trying to figure out which ones of the other ones are worth trying to get back again. And

837
01:01:40.520 --> 01:01:42.459
john bianculli: that's where I'm at right now.

838
01:01:43.580 --> 01:01:49.030
Dolores Albarracin: So is your your job. Now to decide who among the 3.

839
01:01:50.140 --> 01:01:51.870
john bianculli: No, no, the 3. I'm already.

840
01:01:51.870 --> 01:01:52.250
Dolores Albarracin: Trading.

841
01:01:52.250 --> 01:01:53.459
john bianculli: It's the other 12.

842
01:01:54.160 --> 01:01:56.560
Dolores Albarracin: Oh, it's the other 12. Okay?

843
01:01:56.560 --> 01:02:00.929
john bianculli: Yeah, the 3. Yeah, the 3. I. We're good.

844
01:02:01.220 --> 01:02:03.620
john bianculli: The other 12. I'm still working on.

845
01:02:03.620 --> 01:02:09.239
Dolores Albarracin: So the 12 you need to decide if they are safe or risky before

846
01:02:10.140 --> 01:02:11.510
Dolores Albarracin: you reach out.

847
01:02:12.400 --> 01:02:13.090
john bianculli: Yeah.

848
01:02:15.620 --> 01:02:17.789
john bianculli: I mean, because some of the people they're

849
01:02:18.560 --> 01:02:22.800
john bianculli: too stress involved. I don't want to be triggered in drinking and everything else.

850
01:02:25.060 --> 01:02:28.990
Dolores Albarracin: Do you? Do you have an idea of who you will pick next.

851
01:02:31.900 --> 01:02:34.619
john bianculli: yeah, I got an idea.

852
01:02:34.630 --> 01:02:37.290
john bianculli: My one marching friend, I'm thinking about.

853
01:02:38.880 --> 01:02:40.279
Dolores Albarracin: Did you say, Martin.

854
01:02:40.730 --> 01:02:43.320
john bianculli: No Russian. His name's Alex.

855
01:02:43.470 --> 01:02:44.330
Dolores Albarracin: Alex?

856
01:02:46.260 --> 01:02:48.430
Dolores Albarracin: So how do you contact him?

857
01:02:49.240 --> 01:02:50.340
john bianculli: By phone.

858
01:02:51.100 --> 01:02:53.210
john bianculli: This number. I just haven't been calling it.

859
01:02:54.420 --> 01:02:55.270
Dolores Albarracin: And

860
01:02:55.740 --> 01:03:01.629
Dolores Albarracin: you just call just want to see how you're doing, or or what's that conversation like.

861
01:03:02.110 --> 01:03:04.569
john bianculli: Well, I mean, at least I would open up a dialogue.

862
01:03:05.690 --> 01:03:08.130
john bianculli: Maybe I should start out that way. Hey, how are you doing?

863
01:03:09.350 --> 01:03:12.570
john bianculli: I kind of disappeared on people. I've been in California for

864
01:03:12.950 --> 01:03:14.689
john bianculli: 54 days now

865
01:03:17.030 --> 01:03:20.940
john bianculli: I got a text from one of my friends. I didn't even realize I left Pittsburgh, but

866
01:03:21.720 --> 01:03:22.550
john bianculli: oh, well.

867
01:03:23.240 --> 01:03:28.830
Dolores Albarracin: So what do others have to say about this? And maybe

868
01:03:28.850 --> 01:03:32.480
Dolores Albarracin: others were familiar with making amends.

869
01:03:33.110 --> 01:03:34.499
Dolores Albarracin: Lou, you want to speak.

870
01:03:34.500 --> 01:03:38.829
Lewis: I would say, with with moving away to someplace else.

871
01:03:39.360 --> 01:03:44.910
Lewis: and not really staying in contact with the people that you knew that it's almost like

872
01:03:45.190 --> 01:03:53.599
Lewis: that's a good gauge of seeing who really cares about you by them reaching out to you so like you just said someone reached out to you after you've been gone almost 2 months.

873
01:03:54.130 --> 01:04:00.169
Lewis: and are wondering where you are, and didn't even know that you left. That could possibly be somebody that you can have as a friend.

874
01:04:00.250 --> 01:04:02.119
Lewis: as opposed to people that.

875
01:04:02.410 --> 01:04:07.999
Lewis: Yeah, I've I've been dealing with it a lot where it's like they'll say that they care. But the actions don't

876
01:04:08.110 --> 01:04:09.970
Lewis: match up to what they're saying.

877
01:04:10.020 --> 01:04:12.970
Lewis: So you know. Kind of use that as a judge.

878
01:04:13.060 --> 01:04:16.590
Lewis: you know, and and keep it, I would say, to keep it kind of short

879
01:04:16.670 --> 01:04:18.779
Lewis: with the people that you do reach out to

880
01:04:18.950 --> 01:04:33.700
Lewis: is to gauge their kind of level of interest, and how much they care about you. That's the main thing, because there's people that pretend to care. And then there's people that don't really care that don't realize it until you know it's been half a year, or even a year from now and then they go. Oh, wait!

881
01:04:33.760 --> 01:04:44.329
Lewis: Where's John at? You know? So this I know. It's a difficult process, because I I went away to Job Corps for 2 years after, after high school disappeared on a bunch of people.

882
01:04:44.400 --> 01:05:03.490
Lewis: and my best friend growing up, and his friend were the only people that really tried to stay in contact, like, you know, I would have my dad come up and he say, Yeah, you know, address. And and Jason came by looking for you, and I'm like, it's been 4 months since I've been gone. But at the same time I didn't really tell anybody I was leaving, so

883
01:05:03.530 --> 01:05:13.020
Lewis: just try and use that as a gauge to to see who it is that genuinely cares versus people that are trying to use you for what you brought to the situation.

884
01:05:14.540 --> 01:05:18.635
john bianculli: No, that I have to do. I'm gonna be returning back to Pittsburgh

885
01:05:18.960 --> 01:05:21.919
john bianculli: November 29.th I just got my plane ticket.

886
01:05:23.890 --> 01:05:27.439
john bianculli: So that's the part I'm worried about. Whenever I get back home. You know.

887
01:05:27.610 --> 01:05:32.860
Dolores Albarracin: So, yeah, yeah, making that plan. Yeah, where are you going back to?

888
01:05:33.120 --> 01:05:35.570
john bianculli: I don't know. We haven't figured that out yet.

889
01:05:36.570 --> 01:05:38.580
john bianculli: so we figured an end date.

890
01:05:39.460 --> 01:05:46.540
john bianculli: I mean, I kind of wanted to hit a hard deadline, so that I'd start working on going back. I do have a job that I have to get back to

891
01:05:49.690 --> 01:05:55.619
john bianculli: me, putting it off and putting it off and putting it off. I originally was planning on being out here for 30 days.

892
01:05:56.050 --> 01:05:58.459
john bianculli: And yeah, it kind of went a bit longer.

893
01:06:01.790 --> 01:06:10.578
Dolores Albarracin: So I wonder if your your homework should be to work down the list, or or would it be to maybe find a case manager

894
01:06:11.070 --> 01:06:13.409
Dolores Albarracin: in Pittsburgh, or or some.

895
01:06:14.280 --> 01:06:14.850
jennifer bilbrey: No.

896
01:06:14.850 --> 01:06:16.940
Dolores Albarracin: Or do you have that already.

897
01:06:16.940 --> 01:06:21.119
john bianculli: No, that I don't have I I started working with the group

898
01:06:21.610 --> 01:06:25.689
john bianculli: and had a case manager, but then she quit. Now I gotta find another one.

899
01:06:26.630 --> 01:06:29.990
Dolores Albarracin: Would that be a good task for you for next week?

900
01:06:30.520 --> 01:06:32.847
john bianculli: Want to get a new case. Manager.

901
01:06:33.180 --> 01:06:35.360
Dolores Albarracin: Finding out about one.

902
01:06:36.030 --> 01:06:36.630
john bianculli: Yeah.

903
01:06:37.200 --> 01:06:38.249
john bianculli: I could do that.

904
01:06:38.250 --> 01:06:43.270
Dolores Albarracin: Social connection. And it's also your bridge. Yeah, back to Pittsburgh

905
01:06:44.080 --> 01:06:45.410
Dolores Albarracin: favorite.

906
01:06:48.240 --> 01:06:55.169
john bianculli: Sounds like an idea. Yeah, because I'm trying to make sure that I do a good job on cleaning my aftercare. So there isn't a relapse.

907
01:06:55.470 --> 01:07:00.720
Dolores Albarracin: And how would you figure this out? Who could be your case? Manager?

908
01:07:03.020 --> 01:07:07.660
john bianculli: I was talking with the. There's an organization that got my medication for me.

909
01:07:07.840 --> 01:07:11.020
john bianculli: and then they actually mailed it out to California.

910
01:07:12.978 --> 01:07:15.020
john bianculli: I do have a job.

911
01:07:15.490 --> 01:07:16.420
john bianculli: But

912
01:07:16.680 --> 01:07:21.050
john bianculli: right now I don't have any income. So I did find an organization that paid for my meds.

913
01:07:22.600 --> 01:07:30.099
john bianculli: So the same organization, I think, has. I'm gonna try to work with them to try to

914
01:07:31.520 --> 01:07:34.139
john bianculli: find a better environment to live in and

915
01:07:35.100 --> 01:07:38.150
john bianculli: try to get a better aftercare plan, straightened up.

916
01:07:38.740 --> 01:07:43.849
Dolores Albarracin: So would it be a phone call or several phone calls? Or how would you do it?

917
01:07:44.470 --> 01:07:46.220
john bianculli: Well, it's gonna be a phone call.

918
01:07:46.220 --> 01:07:47.604
Dolores Albarracin: Phone call, I think,

919
01:07:49.054 --> 01:07:51.089
Dolores Albarracin: what day could you make this phone call.

920
01:07:53.290 --> 01:07:57.939
john bianculli: Well, I gotta do it quickly, because already I gave myself the hard deadline of the 29.th

921
01:07:58.590 --> 01:08:07.250
john bianculli: So I have clinical and clinical that I have to go to Thursday. I'm thinking that'll be the day that I start the

922
01:08:07.440 --> 01:08:09.900
john bianculli: they're they're really getting on the aftercare.

923
01:08:10.570 --> 01:08:11.799
Dolores Albarracin: Okay. So let's say.

924
01:08:11.800 --> 01:08:12.260
jennifer bilbrey: She!

925
01:08:12.260 --> 01:08:13.570
Dolores Albarracin: Andrea for the phone call.

926
01:08:14.154 --> 01:08:14.740
jennifer bilbrey: Myself.

927
01:08:18.380 --> 01:08:19.429
jennifer bilbrey: this is so rude.

928
01:08:19.430 --> 01:08:21.400
Dolores Albarracin: Mute. Jennifer, please.

929
01:08:21.939 --> 01:08:23.639
jennifer bilbrey: I got a phone screen.

930
01:08:24.109 --> 01:08:24.669
john bianculli: Yeah, so I did.

931
01:08:24.670 --> 01:08:25.039
Dolores Albarracin: No, no.

932
01:08:25.040 --> 01:08:28.270
john bianculli: On Thursday that Friday I have clinical again.

933
01:08:28.279 --> 01:08:35.189
Dolores Albarracin: Okay. So Thursday, okay. Thursday afternoon morning, when it's more convenient for you.

934
01:08:35.189 --> 01:08:39.559
john bianculli: Well, I would probably say, based on, because I'm in a different time. Zone.

935
01:08:40.729 --> 01:08:41.309
jennifer bilbrey: Okay.

936
01:08:41.310 --> 01:08:42.420
john bianculli: Probably.

937
01:08:42.709 --> 01:08:43.269
jennifer bilbrey: Oh!

938
01:08:43.270 --> 01:08:47.869
john bianculli: I'm probably around 12 noon this time would be a good time to get a hold of people.

939
01:08:48.649 --> 01:08:49.180
Patricia Renaud: Okay.

940
01:08:49.180 --> 01:08:49.819
Dolores Albarracin: Right.

941
01:08:50.630 --> 01:08:54.530
Dolores Albarracin: Alright. Well, I look forward to see how that goes. Yeah.

942
01:08:54.779 --> 01:08:58.969
john bianculli: All right. Thanks. Yeah. I got my, I don't know if you think that was a good idea or not.

943
01:08:59.219 --> 01:09:03.489
john bianculli: I kind of set the hard deadline of coming back to work.

944
01:09:03.699 --> 01:09:05.469
john bianculli: December the second.

945
01:09:06.790 --> 01:09:08.029
Dolores Albarracin: Back to work.

946
01:09:08.270 --> 01:09:09.069
john bianculli: Yeah.

947
01:09:10.859 --> 01:09:13.730
john bianculli: I've been gone since September 19.th

948
01:09:14.290 --> 01:09:15.310
Dolores Albarracin: And

949
01:09:15.510 --> 01:09:18.450
Dolores Albarracin: your work again. Remind me what you do.

950
01:09:18.450 --> 01:09:19.609
john bianculli: Banker.

951
01:09:20.960 --> 01:09:22.680
Dolores Albarracin: So I'll

952
01:09:23.430 --> 01:09:26.730
Dolores Albarracin: are you eager to go back? Is it stressful.

953
01:09:28.050 --> 01:09:33.219
john bianculli: Well, see, that's the bad part about it. The work I I know what I'm doing.

954
01:09:33.479 --> 01:09:38.130
john bianculli: It's the inside job is not stressful. It's whenever I leave work, that

955
01:09:38.310 --> 01:09:39.700
john bianculli: I have my problems.

956
01:09:39.970 --> 01:09:41.120
Dolores Albarracin: So it's it's been.

957
01:09:41.438 --> 01:09:42.710
john bianculli: Know that they probably

958
01:09:43.149 --> 01:09:45.199
john bianculli: I was doing yoga.

959
01:09:45.300 --> 01:09:54.960
john bianculli: and you're allowed to laugh if you want to. Just it was kind of weird, they said, like, perfect your picture of the place. You're most comfortable at

960
01:09:55.348 --> 01:10:00.439
john bianculli: and I ended up picturing my desk at work. I'm like you gotta be kidding me.

961
01:10:00.680 --> 01:10:03.225
Dolores Albarracin: Well, then, you needed 2 jobs.

962
01:10:03.650 --> 01:10:07.535
john bianculli: There you go. Yeah, but I can't live at my job, though you have to go home, you know.

963
01:10:07.870 --> 01:10:13.949
john bianculli: That's my problem. Whenever I get it whenever I leave the office inside. I know what I'm doing. It's the outside problem.

964
01:10:14.800 --> 01:10:17.500
Morgan Potts: You don't have to go home, but you can't stay here.

965
01:10:17.930 --> 01:10:18.983
john bianculli: Pretty much.

966
01:10:20.860 --> 01:10:22.876
Dolores Albarracin: I mean, perhaps if you're

967
01:10:23.580 --> 01:10:30.250
Dolores Albarracin: having a decent time and and rehab, maybe just setting up a lot of meetings. Yeah, like.

968
01:10:30.720 --> 01:10:36.450
john bianculli: That's what I'm thinking about doing. I got 2 sponsors in California.

969
01:10:36.590 --> 01:10:39.540
john bianculli: but I definitely have to try to get a Pittsburgh one.

970
01:10:42.510 --> 01:10:48.369
Dolores Albarracin: Yeah, all great ideas. But yeah, for next week the case Manager John.

971
01:10:48.370 --> 01:10:49.680
john bianculli: Okay, that'll be what I work on.

972
01:10:49.680 --> 01:10:51.949
Dolores Albarracin: You're down for it. Okay.

973
01:10:52.190 --> 01:10:55.350
Dolores Albarracin: yeah, Lou, Lou, you've been

974
01:10:56.410 --> 01:11:04.120
Dolores Albarracin: helping everybody. What? What are your thoughts? What do you want to do with your social

975
01:11:04.250 --> 01:11:08.440
Dolores Albarracin: relationships, life losses.

976
01:11:08.980 --> 01:11:16.280
Lewis: I think my main thing is just being more confident in the things that I do, because it was almost like

977
01:11:16.490 --> 01:11:19.879
Lewis: since I was out of high school. I've been really independent.

978
01:11:20.470 --> 01:11:29.799
Lewis: You know, not going by everything that my dad wanted me to do, or everything my mom wanted me to do, and I pretty much been independent for 30 years.

979
01:11:29.890 --> 01:11:35.140
Lewis: but in the last, you know, 3, 4 years everything has started to kind of decline to where.

980
01:11:35.220 --> 01:11:38.980
Lewis: you know. 1st I was. I was struck by a vehicle in 2021,

981
01:11:39.450 --> 01:11:43.380
Lewis: the end of 2022. I had a hernia.

982
01:11:43.470 --> 01:11:48.320
Lewis: and each of those each of those incidents caused me to lose the job that I had

983
01:11:48.560 --> 01:11:53.529
Lewis: so just in the last 2 years. It's been a process of

984
01:11:53.660 --> 01:12:00.839
Lewis: kind of wanting to be more outgoing and and getting back to being myself and being independent. But it almost seems like

985
01:12:02.190 --> 01:12:09.480
Lewis: the job situation, and the home situation is kind of just, you know, like, like John was saying that

986
01:12:10.670 --> 01:12:15.119
Lewis: or that, Frank was saying that there's multiple things that are causing stress on your shoulders

987
01:12:15.280 --> 01:12:27.000
Lewis: where it makes it like you can't. You can't individualize a thing you want to fix. So I think, overall it's just for me being more confident and trying to be more outgoing to the people that I do still have a connection with.

988
01:12:27.930 --> 01:12:32.480
Dolores Albarracin: And who is helping you to get back on your feet, or who.

989
01:12:32.480 --> 01:12:36.088
Lewis: Who the county government.

990
01:12:37.030 --> 01:12:49.399
Lewis: Yeah. My dad lives with my sister, my older sister and her kids are grown. So it's basically just my dad and my sister to live about 70 miles from me

991
01:12:49.420 --> 01:12:56.749
Lewis: in Ashburn. My brother lives fairly close to them, as well as my nephew lives fairly close to them.

992
01:12:56.800 --> 01:13:20.429
Lewis: and they pretty much moved from the area that I'm in now. But I pretty much stayed here because I haven't driven in a couple of years, and my son is about to graduate this coming year. Coming up. So from that point I feel like I don't have to have roots in the place that I stay at, and I'm starting to see that I need to be more confident that I can, you know, move forward and get the things that I needed to get done.

993
01:13:20.712 --> 01:13:27.830
Lewis: Just so I can make decisions on whether or not I want to stay here, whether or not, you know I want to make more money, or where I want to live.

994
01:13:28.410 --> 01:13:29.270
Lewis: but it.

995
01:13:29.270 --> 01:13:31.320
Dolores Albarracin: Right now, Lou.

996
01:13:31.780 --> 01:13:36.580
Dolores Albarracin: you're in no temporary housing or anything.

997
01:13:36.920 --> 01:13:43.910
Lewis: Yeah, I was in the county has like a a housing shelter.

998
01:13:43.940 --> 01:13:46.710
Lewis: but they give you a set amount of time, and I

999
01:13:46.910 --> 01:13:50.240
Lewis: I've pretty much gone through their system.

1000
01:13:50.320 --> 01:13:53.330
Lewis: The 1st time was in 2022

1001
01:13:53.450 --> 01:14:10.249
Lewis: I went through, you know, from the summer of 22 all the way in through till April, and through the list that they have of people that understand their their whole housing assistance thing. I found somebody, but it turned out she was elderly. She had been going to the hospital once a year.

1002
01:14:10.260 --> 01:14:14.570
Lewis: and unfortunately, within about 3, 4 months of me staying with her. She passed away.

1003
01:14:14.870 --> 01:14:24.099
Lewis: So in that regard it was like, you know, I always trying to stay optimistic. I'm not super religious, but I'm religious enough to like.

1004
01:14:24.150 --> 01:14:42.629
Lewis: pray for somebody that I care about. So I always had the optimism that she would come back from the hospital where everything would be fine. She was telling me. You know, we'll we'll worry about the rent and all that stuff later, and that type of thing. And then, you know, that happened. And I ended up meeting her family that I'd never even met before. I'd only been living there about 4 months.

1005
01:14:42.710 --> 01:14:54.409
Lewis: so unfortunately, I ended up back in the system and going through the housing shelter. And this time I ended up using up all of my time, because that kind of put me in a depression

1006
01:14:54.630 --> 01:14:55.470
Lewis: to where.

1007
01:14:55.470 --> 01:14:58.090
Dolores Albarracin: Imagine. Oh, my, gosh, yeah.

1008
01:14:58.090 --> 01:14:59.040
Lewis: All my efforts.

1009
01:14:59.040 --> 01:15:02.030
Dolores Albarracin: Who is your 17 year old son with you.

1010
01:15:02.300 --> 01:15:02.960
Dolores Albarracin: or when his.

1011
01:15:02.960 --> 01:15:12.240
Lewis: No, no, he lives with his mom, but he's, I would say, like 15 mile, 15 min away, that I can catch the bus, so we can meet up at the Mall. Things like that.

1012
01:15:12.240 --> 01:15:12.690
Dolores Albarracin: I wonder!

1013
01:15:12.690 --> 01:15:13.160
Lewis: So.

1014
01:15:13.160 --> 01:15:17.420
Dolores Albarracin: Frank. Frank might have any suggestions for Lou.

1015
01:15:18.800 --> 01:15:22.540
Frank: It's tricky, I mean. What what state are you in? I didn't catch that.

1016
01:15:22.540 --> 01:15:25.849
Lewis: Virginia, about 35 miles south of DC.

1017
01:15:26.260 --> 01:15:31.129
Frank: Okay, I was in that area before in Norfolk.

1018
01:15:31.370 --> 01:15:35.660
Frank: But yeah, man, I mean, it's it's tough. When you're

1019
01:15:35.670 --> 01:15:36.760
Frank: when you're

1020
01:15:37.040 --> 01:15:41.989
Frank: a a single man like there's there's not a lot of resources for

1021
01:15:42.030 --> 01:15:44.286
Frank: solo men, you know.

1022
01:15:47.100 --> 01:15:58.750
Frank: it's tricky, I mean, I think. I think the the same thing as I'm sorry I forgot what his name was. The guy that's in John. Is it? Do you have a a social worker

1023
01:15:58.900 --> 01:15:59.499
Frank: like a case?

1024
01:15:59.500 --> 01:15:59.830
john bianculli: Sorry.

1025
01:16:00.184 --> 01:16:10.119
Lewis: Well, it's been kind of on and off, because when I was in the shelter they assign you one but since then I was. I was

1026
01:16:10.120 --> 01:16:36.469
Lewis: taken out of the system in the middle of June. Pretty much. Had to find a tent and make it through the whole summer until they just recently opened up the other shelter for the wintertime. But I had. I had a counselor assigned to me while I was there, and then I would drop in over the summer. They let you come in in the morning time. Take your shower, eat breakfast, charge up your stuff all that good stuff. And we've had. You know, we've had a connection and had a relationship. But it's just

1027
01:16:37.120 --> 01:16:38.620
Lewis: you start to feel like

1028
01:16:38.700 --> 01:16:49.469
Lewis: when you're in that situation, and it doesn't improve. It almost feels like everybody's against you. So it's more like she's helping. But she's employed to help me. You know what I mean.

1029
01:16:49.790 --> 01:16:52.939
Frank: Yeah. Yeah. And also, I mean housing.

1030
01:16:53.010 --> 01:16:57.889
Frank: It's so difficult to get into housing. You know, I

1031
01:16:57.990 --> 01:17:06.970
Frank: that if you get on a list for like Section 8, you might be waiting 2 years to get into somewhere. So I I understand that. And I mean it's

1032
01:17:07.480 --> 01:17:10.440
Frank: and if I hadn't, you know, had

1033
01:17:10.470 --> 01:17:17.320
Frank: a friend to move in with, I'd still be on in a tent, you know. Because it's so difficult to find housing.

1034
01:17:17.320 --> 01:17:17.740
Dolores Albarracin: No.

1035
01:17:17.740 --> 01:17:20.349
Frank: I wish I had more, more optimism for you.

1036
01:17:20.350 --> 01:17:22.150
Lewis: No, no, it's it's understandable. It's just.

1037
01:17:22.150 --> 01:17:32.019
Dolores Albarracin: Anyway, at least, you know, you know you know what he's talking about. So, Lou, your dad and sister.

1038
01:17:32.110 --> 01:17:37.900
Dolores Albarracin: How about them? Since your your son is, is not living with you.

1039
01:17:38.140 --> 01:17:42.729
Dolores Albarracin: Would that be a possibility, and then maybe travel to see your son.

1040
01:17:43.650 --> 01:17:48.410
Lewis: Well, my! My relationship with my dad is kind of strained. He is in.

1041
01:17:48.620 --> 01:17:49.110
Patricia Renaud: He is.

1042
01:17:49.110 --> 01:17:54.690
Lewis: In his retirement phase, within the last 2 years of me, going through the most difficult time of my life.

1043
01:17:54.800 --> 01:17:59.010
Lewis: So he was only able to help, but so much.

1044
01:17:59.070 --> 01:18:00.590
Lewis: and it's kind of

1045
01:18:00.850 --> 01:18:08.110
Lewis: falling off from that point. I don't know if it was I was asking too much, or he was wanting me to do something, and I was like, no, I'm not going to do that.

1046
01:18:08.230 --> 01:18:13.570
Lewis: I'm not sure what caused kind of the riff in that, but it's gotten, you know, sporadic.

1047
01:18:13.570 --> 01:18:19.560
Dolores Albarracin: Would maybe maybe a phone call with your dad or Zoom Meeting. Would that be

1048
01:18:20.360 --> 01:18:22.760
Dolores Albarracin: good idea for next week?

1049
01:18:23.210 --> 01:18:24.879
Lewis: Yeah, cause I it's

1050
01:18:24.970 --> 01:18:39.480
Lewis: my my immediate family all still live in the same state as me, but it seems like there's still way more distance than there should be for them, being, you know, within the same state. So yeah, definitely to try and reach out to my brother and my sister.

1051
01:18:39.480 --> 01:18:45.069
Dolores Albarracin: When would you do that? Would it be your your dad, or your sister, or both?

1052
01:18:45.510 --> 01:18:57.599
Lewis: Probably probably to everybody. Between the 4 of them. Just to kind of reach out to them over the weekend when I know they're not busy. Everybody's working. Everybody has their own life going on.

1053
01:18:57.600 --> 01:19:03.419
Dolores Albarracin: One, pick one, and and just tell me about one. And when would you call.

1054
01:19:04.255 --> 01:19:19.370
Lewis: Probably my dad and I try and reach out to him over the weekend, either Saturday or Sunday, when I know he'll be home, cleaning his house or washing clothes, washing dishes, doing something, cooking around the house, anything like that, where I know he's kind of wound down, and he's not in.

1055
01:19:19.410 --> 01:19:22.259
Lewis: He's in a different mood and a different mind. State.

1056
01:19:22.820 --> 01:19:24.819
Dolores Albarracin: And what would you say? Just

1057
01:19:26.430 --> 01:19:28.750
Dolores Albarracin: Hello! What would you say?

1058
01:19:29.060 --> 01:19:30.610
Lewis: Is, I don't know.

1059
01:19:31.910 --> 01:19:37.210
Lewis: I'd probably start off saying, Hey, it's it's your oldest son, and see where he takes it from. There.

1060
01:19:37.210 --> 01:19:40.220
Dolores Albarracin: How many, how many sons does he have.

1061
01:19:40.804 --> 01:19:49.619
Lewis: So I have a older, older sister and a younger brother, and we're each separated by 6 years. So my sister is 6 years older than me.

1062
01:19:49.730 --> 01:19:53.018
Lewis: My brother is 6 years younger than me.

1063
01:19:53.430 --> 01:19:57.010
Dolores Albarracin: You're the you're the middle middle child.

1064
01:19:57.260 --> 01:19:57.585
Lewis: Yeah.

1065
01:19:57.910 --> 01:20:00.940
Dolores Albarracin: Okay. So you would say that. And then what.

1066
01:20:01.829 --> 01:20:19.100
Lewis: Just kind of, you know. I I think the main thing in not having contact with people over a period of time that you've been connected to is just to kind of catch up. You know, Major, things that have gone on since you've talked to that person, or since you've seen them.

1067
01:20:19.540 --> 01:20:21.159
Lewis: because I can see

1068
01:20:21.590 --> 01:20:26.920
Lewis: my dad and my sister I probably haven't seen since last Thanksgiving, and we're coming up on Thanksgiving now.

1069
01:20:27.700 --> 01:20:29.260
Dolores Albarracin: Yeah, so, maybe just.

1070
01:20:29.260 --> 01:20:30.701
Lewis: I saw over the summer.

1071
01:20:30.990 --> 01:20:36.219
Dolores Albarracin: Catching up, and I miss you and then you'll call.

1072
01:20:36.220 --> 01:20:46.440
Lewis: Yeah, kind of kind of just catching up and then kind of seeing where the conversation goes. Who's gonna take the 1st step into apologizing or trying to figure out.

1073
01:20:47.616 --> 01:20:49.970
Dolores Albarracin: Nothing happened.

1074
01:20:50.240 --> 01:20:50.650
Lewis: Yep.

1075
01:20:50.650 --> 01:20:52.989
Dolores Albarracin: Okay, so just 13 days.

1076
01:20:53.440 --> 01:20:53.990
Lewis: Yep.

1077
01:20:53.990 --> 01:21:07.909
Dolores Albarracin: By next Tuesday and and telling us so I wanna invite Jennifer. Jennifer, you've been hearing we started at 5. So next Tuesday it will be at 5,

1078
01:21:08.240 --> 01:21:17.980
Dolores Albarracin: and you know we've been having this conversation, and each each member of the group has been talking. So

1079
01:21:18.660 --> 01:21:28.440
Dolores Albarracin: there isn't time to really introduce everybody again. But why don't you tell us where you are? Who you live with? Why are you here?

1080
01:21:28.440 --> 01:21:37.050
jennifer bilbrey: Okay. My name is Jennifer. I am in Saint Louis, Missouri. I live with my son's father

1081
01:21:37.060 --> 01:21:40.990
jennifer bilbrey: and myself. That's it. And I am here

1082
01:21:41.090 --> 01:21:47.920
jennifer bilbrey: to, because I think I would have a lot of valuable input to give for the study purposes. I really do

1083
01:21:47.960 --> 01:21:49.140
jennifer bilbrey: from the

1084
01:21:49.190 --> 01:21:52.080
jennifer bilbrey: behavioral standpoint with addiction and

1085
01:21:52.090 --> 01:21:56.910
jennifer bilbrey: behaviors behind that. And you know that sort of thing. And I think I have a lot of valuable input.

1086
01:21:57.780 --> 01:21:58.890
Dolores Albarracin: Okay.

1087
01:21:59.090 --> 01:22:01.159
Dolores Albarracin: well, thank you.

1088
01:22:01.260 --> 01:22:10.670
Dolores Albarracin: And when you think of this question, we've been asking, yeah, what would you like to fix one relationship one, maybe

1089
01:22:11.060 --> 01:22:16.809
Dolores Albarracin: creating a new relationship, maybe fixing an old relationship. What would you say.

1090
01:22:17.430 --> 01:22:20.120
jennifer bilbrey: I would say, me and my mother's me and my mom's relationship

1091
01:22:20.550 --> 01:22:21.470
jennifer bilbrey: for sure.

1092
01:22:22.625 --> 01:22:24.754
jennifer bilbrey: We just. She's she's very

1093
01:22:25.390 --> 01:22:26.319
jennifer bilbrey: kind of like

1094
01:22:26.640 --> 01:22:35.082
jennifer bilbrey: stoic. She's she's real strong and intense all the time, and it's just something that I'm can't get used to. I guess I don't know.

1095
01:22:35.820 --> 01:22:38.639
jennifer bilbrey: yeah, I definitely picked her. And I'm sorry.

1096
01:22:38.640 --> 01:22:40.090
Dolores Albarracin: Speaker, or you don't.

1097
01:22:40.090 --> 01:23:05.649
jennifer bilbrey: Oh, yeah, I see her all the time. Yeah, yeah, she she only lives about 5 min away from me. But I just have never been able to like call her and just talk to her about. You know, some of my problems, especially relationship problems, especially kid problems, because I've raised one son. She's raised 3 kids so there's there's not a lot of empathy or sympathy there for me when I'm calling crying about my you know, distress calls as as a mom, you know. So

1098
01:23:05.930 --> 01:23:07.029
Dolores Albarracin: Oh, yeah.

1099
01:23:07.030 --> 01:23:07.590
jennifer bilbrey: Yeah. But I think

1100
01:23:07.940 --> 01:23:08.270
jennifer bilbrey: you're like.

1101
01:23:08.270 --> 01:23:12.380
Dolores Albarracin: We don't do. We don't do miracles here, Jennifer, so.

1102
01:23:12.380 --> 01:23:12.750
jennifer bilbrey: Right.

1103
01:23:12.750 --> 01:23:13.500
Dolores Albarracin: Okay.

1104
01:23:14.220 --> 01:23:19.039
Dolores Albarracin: Mother has no empathy. I don't know that you can fix that right, but.

1105
01:23:19.040 --> 01:23:24.144
jennifer bilbrey: Right? Right? Well, I can't. I mean, I can't. And that's okay. I'm just trying. I just I just

1106
01:23:24.630 --> 01:23:33.279
jennifer bilbrey: Maybe my approach can be changed. That would, maybe, you know, change how she then respond to me because I can't change anything about her, you know. I can just

1107
01:23:33.480 --> 01:23:45.779
jennifer bilbrey: just changed me, anyway. So yeah, if I could fix, I just want to make it a little bit stronger. I just wish I don't know. Maybe I just I don't know.

1108
01:23:48.540 --> 01:23:56.150
Dolores Albarracin: I'm just trying to picture. Well, first, st we don't know if what you would like could exist. Yeah, with your mom. But

1109
01:23:56.320 --> 01:24:00.629
Dolores Albarracin: do you imagine a situation, or encounter, or or.

1110
01:24:00.630 --> 01:24:09.059
jennifer bilbrey: I mean, I don't want you to be able to call her about something, and and you know, either tell her about a good day or a bad day, and not be criticized about it

1111
01:24:09.140 --> 01:24:17.550
jennifer bilbrey: or not. Be, you know, it's just a lot of negativity comes from everything. I just want to be able to call her, or maybe be happy to hear from me. Sometimes.

1112
01:24:17.680 --> 01:24:19.180
jennifer bilbrey: You know things like that.

1113
01:24:20.050 --> 01:24:22.879
Dolores Albarracin: So how about just texting her.

1114
01:24:24.313 --> 01:24:33.430
jennifer bilbrey: I do. I do. And she doesn't respond most of the time. But that's okay, because I know she read it, you know, and that's okay. She is who she is, and I love her to death. But

1115
01:24:34.630 --> 01:24:35.190
jennifer bilbrey: huh!

1116
01:24:36.580 --> 01:24:40.880
Morgan Potts: We were saying. I'm sorry to interrupt Jennifer. I was just wanted to interject.

1117
01:24:40.960 --> 01:24:49.860
Morgan Potts: because I understand your situation. We were saying earlier that just because their family does not make them automatically good people.

1118
01:24:51.410 --> 01:24:53.200
Morgan Potts: and

1119
01:24:53.850 --> 01:25:00.149
Morgan Potts: the root of disappointment is expecting from others what you would do for them.

1120
01:25:02.200 --> 01:25:02.860
jennifer bilbrey: True. Yeah.

1121
01:25:04.730 --> 01:25:08.230
jennifer bilbrey: you know, she she still criticizes me for things I did 15 years ago.

1122
01:25:08.970 --> 01:25:11.170
Morgan Potts: You ain't. Gonna you're not gonna change that, honey.

1123
01:25:12.310 --> 01:25:12.860
jennifer bilbrey: Right.

1124
01:25:13.410 --> 01:25:18.499
Dolores Albarracin: Yeah, then, other than maybe you invite her to watch a movie or something

1125
01:25:18.740 --> 01:25:21.240
Dolores Albarracin: that doesn't allow her to speak.

1126
01:25:21.460 --> 01:25:22.119
jennifer bilbrey: You know. That's a good.

1127
01:25:23.790 --> 01:25:24.690
Patricia Renaud: Yeah, instead of.

1128
01:25:24.980 --> 01:25:25.310
Dolores Albarracin: Yeah.

1129
01:25:25.310 --> 01:25:27.800
jennifer bilbrey: For a problem or or a solution. Maybe I should just call.

1130
01:25:27.800 --> 01:25:30.040
Dolores Albarracin: Very loud play.

1131
01:25:31.120 --> 01:25:39.209
Dolores Albarracin: Try that. Yeah. Invite her for a movie. Then mom goes home and no criticism.

1132
01:25:39.210 --> 01:25:42.540
jennifer bilbrey: Right? Right? That's a great idea. Actually. Hmm.

1133
01:25:42.900 --> 01:25:44.819
Dolores Albarracin: And tell us how it goes.

1134
01:25:44.990 --> 01:25:46.320
jennifer bilbrey: I will! I will!

1135
01:25:46.760 --> 01:25:49.016
Dolores Albarracin: All right. Well, we

1136
01:25:49.800 --> 01:25:53.579
Dolores Albarracin: we're almost out of time. So I want to just

1137
01:25:54.140 --> 01:25:56.950
Dolores Albarracin: allow everybody to

1138
01:25:57.030 --> 01:26:06.889
Dolores Albarracin: share and and thank others for for what? You heard today, something that you liked in others, something you appreciated

1139
01:26:07.330 --> 01:26:10.970
Dolores Albarracin: very briefly, but at least some thoughts.

1140
01:26:12.910 --> 01:26:13.740
Morgan Potts: Oh!

1141
01:26:14.620 --> 01:26:15.540
jennifer bilbrey: Go ahead!

1142
01:26:16.900 --> 01:26:17.640
Dolores Albarracin: They're not.

1143
01:26:17.640 --> 01:26:20.270
Morgan Potts: I I was just gonna say.

1144
01:26:21.360 --> 01:26:23.980
Morgan Potts: Lewis, you're a cool guy.

1145
01:26:24.630 --> 01:26:37.930
Morgan Potts: I love the way you think, and I am not a miracle worker. By no means. But I've spent 20 years in local government. I know how things work. And I'm also a really good Internet sleuth. So

1146
01:26:38.140 --> 01:27:06.640
Morgan Potts: I'm just throwing this at you. If you want to contact me on that platform thing that we have, and just give me some general location. I heard your your serving and all that I've been there. I've done that. I've got some ideas for you that might be helpful. There are some depending upon where you're at. There are some places like a restaurant that will employ folks

1147
01:27:07.170 --> 01:27:09.309
Morgan Potts: and give them places

1148
01:27:09.430 --> 01:27:21.250
Morgan Potts: to help them get back on their feet. I don't know if that exists where you are, but I certainly don't mind spending time Googling, and looking for you.

1149
01:27:21.570 --> 01:27:30.760
Morgan Potts: so you just just throw it out there and thanks everybody for your for your time. Y'all have been really cool people. I was very apprehensive about this, but y'all are really awesome.

1150
01:27:31.270 --> 01:27:36.780
Dolores Albarracin: So, Lou, you can. Text, Morgan, your email or phone number. Yeah.

1151
01:27:36.780 --> 01:27:39.600
Lewis: I did sign on to the there's a.

1152
01:27:39.600 --> 01:27:41.680
Dolores Albarracin: So you can connect there.

1153
01:27:41.885 --> 01:27:42.500
Lewis: Didn't figure out.

1154
01:27:43.260 --> 01:27:45.284
Dolores Albarracin: That's very generous of of

1155
01:27:45.690 --> 01:27:47.180
Lewis: Yeah, I appreciate that.

1156
01:27:47.910 --> 01:27:49.540
Lewis: So, yeah, there are others.

1157
01:27:49.540 --> 01:27:54.590
Dolores Albarracin: Oh, it's things you appreciated, admired about members.

1158
01:27:54.590 --> 01:28:07.600
jennifer bilbrey: What I would, I would I like I 1st of all, I apologize for for being late, because my zoom was not working properly, so let me just 1st off I was. I apologize for being late. But what what I just heard from like Morgan. It's kind of like

1159
01:28:08.080 --> 01:28:24.809
jennifer bilbrey: reinstores, like kind of my faith in people sometimes, because I know you know, people are especially after like Post Covid and all that stuff people are kind of, you know to themselves a lot now, and seeing a stranger want to help another stranger without any strings attached at all. Kind of, you know.

1160
01:28:24.980 --> 01:28:28.930
jennifer bilbrey: gives me some faith that you know it's not. It's not all bad all the time, you know.

1161
01:28:30.800 --> 01:28:32.410
Dolores Albarracin: Thanks for saying this.

1162
01:28:32.970 --> 01:28:33.700
Dolores Albarracin: No

1163
01:28:36.340 --> 01:28:37.000
Dolores Albarracin: others.

1164
01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:44.060
Lewis: Yeah, I would just say, I I really appreciate everybody sharing. I know it's hard like Jennifer was just saying that

1165
01:28:44.280 --> 01:29:06.539
Lewis: it's kind of individualized us from what we had to go through for 2020 and 2021. So for us to be able to share these things and all be in different locations across the country, and you're open to sharing a little bit of yourself. We appreciate it, and it also kind of not really bonds. But it kind of shows you there's a connection. People aren't as different as you think. They are.

1166
01:29:10.530 --> 01:29:12.490
Dolores Albarracin: Not Petra, Petra.

1167
01:29:12.490 --> 01:29:14.530
Petra Teeter 237121: Very true, very true.

1168
01:29:15.390 --> 01:29:20.780
Petra Teeter 237121: I can only agree. Everybody is like saying these things. I can only agree so much.

1169
01:29:20.820 --> 01:29:22.060
Petra Teeter 237121: It's just.

1170
01:29:22.110 --> 01:29:25.349
Petra Teeter 237121: It's just amazing. I didn't know what to expect

1171
01:29:25.400 --> 01:29:26.945
Petra Teeter 237121: from this. And

1172
01:29:28.434 --> 01:29:29.170
Petra Teeter 237121: I

1173
01:29:29.460 --> 01:29:31.676
Petra Teeter 237121: I've learned so much. And

1174
01:29:32.670 --> 01:29:38.799
Petra Teeter 237121: it's just I see that. Well, I'm I'm 55 years old. So I'm on the older

1175
01:29:38.970 --> 01:29:40.180
Petra Teeter 237121: side, I guess.

1176
01:29:40.400 --> 01:29:43.769
Petra Teeter 237121: and I see people struggling. And

1177
01:29:43.830 --> 01:29:51.630
Petra Teeter 237121: and then there's my sons. I see them struggle, too, and it's just. It's all like repeating itself when I'm like, Oh.

1178
01:29:51.700 --> 01:29:55.810
Petra Teeter 237121: I just want to put it out there just because they're family, and I mean

1179
01:29:55.870 --> 01:30:00.990
Petra Teeter 237121: you heard me. My own husband and my sons are all that I

1180
01:30:01.250 --> 01:30:03.810
Petra Teeter 237121: they are like my number one in my life.

1181
01:30:04.460 --> 01:30:05.270
Petra Teeter 237121: but

1182
01:30:05.780 --> 01:30:06.990
Petra Teeter 237121: my own parents.

1183
01:30:08.170 --> 01:30:13.730
Petra Teeter 237121: I should have never even tried I should have not wasted my time on them. And that's a horrible statement.

1184
01:30:13.940 --> 01:30:15.789
Petra Teeter 237121: a horrible, horrible statement.

1185
01:30:16.310 --> 01:30:17.499
Lewis: Well, you gotta try.

1186
01:30:17.500 --> 01:30:23.929
Petra Teeter 237121: I did. Yeah, I did. I did take a lesson from that. And one of the things I have to say is.

1187
01:30:24.660 --> 01:30:27.179
Petra Teeter 237121: I don't like to be a victim.

1188
01:30:27.540 --> 01:30:28.440
Petra Teeter 237121: I'm not.

1189
01:30:28.681 --> 01:30:29.890
Dolores Albarracin: That's it. There you go!

1190
01:30:29.890 --> 01:30:30.929
Petra Teeter 237121: There you go!

1191
01:30:30.930 --> 01:30:31.960
Dolores Albarracin: Rewind.

1192
01:30:32.210 --> 01:30:34.290
Dolores Albarracin: so don't.

1193
01:30:34.290 --> 01:30:36.520
Petra Teeter 237121: Not victims. So there you go!

1194
01:30:36.750 --> 01:30:41.820
Dolores Albarracin: John, Frank, Michelle and Pat, I want to just allow you a minute to

1195
01:30:42.170 --> 01:30:44.780
Dolores Albarracin: send something back to the group. Yeah.

1196
01:30:45.448 --> 01:30:52.280
Patricia Renaud: I just found this very interesting. And looking forward to the next session.

1197
01:30:52.460 --> 01:30:54.480
Patricia Renaud: Everybody, you know.

1198
01:30:55.030 --> 01:30:59.670
Patricia Renaud: had a lot of good insight and had a lot to offer, and

1199
01:31:00.060 --> 01:31:02.390
Patricia Renaud: I'm looking forward to you know

1200
01:31:02.950 --> 01:31:06.900
Patricia Renaud: what everybody accomplished next week.

1201
01:31:08.440 --> 01:31:09.000
Dolores Albarracin: Thank you.

1202
01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:12.090
Michelle: I've loved hearing everyone's stories and

1203
01:31:12.490 --> 01:31:17.899
Michelle: it's cool, seeing everyone's different journey of life, and I can't wait to see where we all go.

1204
01:31:20.896 --> 01:31:21.810
Dolores Albarracin: Frank, you.

1205
01:31:21.810 --> 01:31:25.529
Frank: Yeah, yeah, it's Yeah. I was a little like

1206
01:31:25.650 --> 01:31:37.649
Frank: I was a little apprehensive, like, Pat said, I'm not pat. I'm sorry. It was Morgan that said that about getting on here. I didn't know kind of what it would be like, but it's been nice to kind of see

1207
01:31:38.010 --> 01:31:43.045
Frank: full spectrum of people, and it kind of reminds me it humbles me about where I've been, you know.

1208
01:31:43.310 --> 01:31:44.100
jennifer bilbrey: Move in there.

1209
01:31:44.100 --> 01:31:50.410
Frank: Been in the same position. That maybe not exactly, but that Lewis is in right now. And I know how tough it can be out there. So

1210
01:31:51.760 --> 01:32:04.109
Frank: And it's also good to see people reaching out when when they don't have to like like, Jennifer said. You know, seeing people doing things without strings attached is something on the streets that you you come to expect from people, and it's really hard.

1211
01:32:04.580 --> 01:32:10.350
Frank: when you leave the streets, to, to let people do things for you because you think well, what do you want in return?

1212
01:32:10.350 --> 01:32:10.800
jennifer bilbrey: Yeah.

1213
01:32:10.800 --> 01:32:15.069
Frank: Because there's always something. So it it's nice to see that.

1214
01:32:16.410 --> 01:32:23.349
Dolores Albarracin: Very nice. Well, it's an honor to meet you all, and I very much look forward to seeing you next week.

1215
01:32:23.740 --> 01:32:34.480
Dolores Albarracin: and there is a little message from Feng about, you know. Payments will come in within 3 to 5 days. You can read that. But yeah, and great to meet you all, and

1216
01:32:35.140 --> 01:32:38.239
Dolores Albarracin: let us know if you have any questions. Yeah.

1217
01:32:38.240 --> 01:32:41.690
jennifer bilbrey: Okay, I'll see you next. We'll see you next week. Thank you.

1218

1219
01:32:47.000 --> 01:32:49.909
Dolores Albarracin: let us know. Okay, thank you.

1220
01:32:49.910 --> 01:32:50.790
john bianculli: Say it that way.

1221
01:32:50.790 --> 01:32:53.500
Lewis: Alright, guys, stay positive. Thank you.

1222
01:32:53.500 --> 01:32:55.549
Dolores Albarracin: Thank you. Thank you.
