13
00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:05.500

14
00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:13.539
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: important for us and and in our lives, and and then also a goal setting piece. So we really wanted to identify some goals

15
00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:17.540
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: for all of us individually as we.

16
00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:23.640
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: We moved through the week. And we're going to start today by doing a quick recap

17
00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:30.850
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: of those goals, and and how the these last 2 weeks have went, and then talk about

18
00:01:32.041 --> 00:01:41.080
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: how we can continue that on that quest, so to speak, to improve our own health, and and then we'll look at our goals that we made last week, and see if we need to make

19
00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:49.960
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: any adjustments to those. And so with that, who would like to to start with 1st by

20
00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:54.979
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: telling talking about the goal that you named the last time we were together, and and how everything went.

21
00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:01.910
Christian: I can begin. This is Christian.

22
00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:03.120
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: Hi. Christian.

23
00:02:04.192 --> 00:02:08.080
Christian: Good afternoon. I trust your Thanksgiving was good.

24
00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:19.439
Christian: It was. It was fantastic good like to hear that my goal was to not drink as frequently.

25
00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:25.110
Christian: I'm pretty much a everyday drinker, and

26
00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:32.860
Christian: so far I have failed to skip a day every other day.

27
00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:39.662
Christian: I'm kind of working myself into it. I've skipped a couple of days, not in a row, but couple of

28
00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:43.899
Christian: second day type things and

29
00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:48.330
Christian: I have also limited my intake.

30
00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:55.020
Christian: So I'm moving forward in that arena.

31
00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:00.609
Christian: And I also have re-engaged with volunteerism.

32
00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:03.379
Christian: I'm doing meals on wheels

33
00:03:05.617 --> 00:03:11.870
Christian: and at the moment it's couple of days a week. I'm kind of filling in when

34
00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:15.290
Christian: they have people that can't make it.

35
00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:18.550
Christian: because they kind of have the regular crew.

36
00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:26.543
Christian: But so I'm pretty happy. Everything has gone smoothly.

37
00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:29.950
Christian: and I think you know, in

38
00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:36.360
Christian: response to your second thing about you know what we need to move or what I need to do. Moving forward

39
00:03:37.244 --> 00:03:43.780
Christian: I find that if I don't have any booze in the house it's easier opportunistic.

40
00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:46.450
Christian: It's there. I'm gonna use it.

41
00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:48.570
Christian: That's not there.

42
00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:54.810
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: And so, since we since we last met, do you?

43
00:03:54.850 --> 00:04:01.050
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: You said you've pretty much have you drink every day for the exception of 2 days, or

44
00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:02.920
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: how did how did that look.

45
00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:12.680
Christian: Well, now, you know I this was prior to Thanksgiving, so really, probably about 4 days out of 14.

46
00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:13.530
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: Okay.

47
00:04:15.986 --> 00:04:20.589
Christian: And well, that's the answer.

48
00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:23.430
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: Did you feel like that? Was a success for you?

49
00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:24.500
Christian: Oh yes!

50
00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:27.220
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: Good. How how did that feel

51
00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:30.415
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: doing less of that? Did you notice any?

52
00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:39.020
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: anything that happened as a result of of drinking less with with relationships with your health, anything that.

53
00:04:40.093 --> 00:04:41.259
Christian: Not yet.

54
00:04:41.717 --> 00:04:49.770
Christian: Although I can tell you from you know my other sober periods that my health will get better.

55
00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:57.950
Christian: You know I didn't drink for like 6 years, so it was. You feel different.

56
00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:00.549
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: Would would

57
00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:04.996
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: when you have when you got together, for did you get together with family friends for Thanksgiving?

58
00:05:05.627 --> 00:05:09.110
Christian: Just my significant other. All my family's in Chicago.

59
00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:09.510
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: Okay.

60
00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:11.010
Christian: And so we didn't travel.

61
00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:13.580
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: They're they're snowed in in Chicago.

62
00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:23.450
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: What those 4 times that you did drink? Was there a particular trigger, or something happened where

63
00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:27.709
Christian: You. You decided to drink.

64
00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:36.750
Christian: Not really. No, I'm sorry the times I did not drink, or the times I did drink.

65
00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:38.109
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: The times you did drink.

66
00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:42.190
Christian: Oh, it's a little habitual

67
00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:46.890
Christian: after like 6, 30, or 7 o'clock at night.

68
00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:48.760
Christian: It's time for a drink,

69
00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:59.310
Christian: And but there was no other trigger than habitual, and sometimes boredom.

70
00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:00.660
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: Okay?

71
00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:04.420
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: And and you mentioned you were becoming more

72
00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:08.199
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: volunteering with meals on wheels. Was that

73
00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:11.960
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: as a response to for for the less boredom piece of it.

74
00:06:12.408 --> 00:06:14.201
Christian: Well, definitely, plus, it's

75
00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:18.489
Christian: you know I have the time. I might as well give it to somebody.

76
00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:20.210
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: It can use it.

77
00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:25.909
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: And you you mentioned it's habitual, and if it's if it's there.

78
00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:35.990
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: you know, you'll probably you'll probably drink it. Are there any barriers to having it around less that you've.

79
00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:40.710
Christian: No, not really. I mean

80
00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:46.279
Christian: My significant other drinks one or 2 glasses of wine at night.

81
00:06:47.707 --> 00:06:50.632
Christian: I don't usually drink her wine, and

82
00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:54.470
Christian: so no, not really. I mean.

83
00:06:54.550 --> 00:06:57.385
Christian: I drive by the liquor store every day.

84
00:06:58.210 --> 00:07:02.130
Christian: and I can find myself not stopping in.

85
00:07:03.820 --> 00:07:09.299
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: So so really and and just to recap just having having something to do.

86
00:07:09.490 --> 00:07:15.610
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: whether it's connecting with people volunteering, participating in those things will

87
00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:19.380
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: make it less like less likely for you to drink. Is that.

88
00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:21.209
Christian: Oh, that's correct.

89
00:07:21.390 --> 00:07:25.580
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: Correct. Okay, when you when you think about

90
00:07:26.700 --> 00:07:30.209
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: well, actually, let's let's connect it. Let's connect that later. I don't wanna

91
00:07:30.580 --> 00:07:32.980
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: jump too far into it now. But

92
00:07:33.494 --> 00:07:37.010
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: put that in the bike rack, and we'll connect on that a little bit later.

93
00:07:37.030 --> 00:07:39.420
Christian: Anyone else. Shannon.

94
00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:44.009
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: Stacy, how did how did your week go or 2 weeks go.

95
00:07:49.050 --> 00:07:59.520
Stacey Ford: It's very hectic. I'm exhausted. Again. It's mostly been invested helping my brother and running back and forth to the hospital

96
00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:00.450
Stacey Ford: and

97
00:08:01.270 --> 00:08:12.603
Stacey Ford: getting the house ready for him to come home. We we didn't. I didn't expect him to come home for probably another. They were talking at least 5 weeks. So it's a really it was

98
00:08:13.540 --> 00:08:22.230
Stacey Ford: I I was caught off guard when they said they're gonna release him, and I had a lot of work to do because he can't. He can't go upstairs or anything. So I had to rearrange the whole house

99
00:08:22.430 --> 00:08:35.149
Stacey Ford: and make everything accessible to him downstairs, for now while he goes through rehabilitation because he I mean he lost feelings in his legs and arms and hands, and

100
00:08:35.659 --> 00:08:49.719
Stacey Ford: It had a so he's learning to walk again, and strength and stuff like that. So it's been really hectic. With that being said, is he? This group helps.

101
00:08:50.140 --> 00:09:10.469
Stacey Ford: I mean, I I don't. I'm sure it's gonna help in several different ways, but mostly knowledge. And my brother needs to quit doing drugs and drinking and smoking, and so he does. Cocaine. He smokes weed, he drinks alcohol, he smokes cigarettes, he quit cigarettes

102
00:09:11.557 --> 00:09:21.710
Stacey Ford: weed or marijuana and drinking. So those 3 things. And so now I I'm not drinking for his sake.

103
00:09:22.246 --> 00:09:34.193
Stacey Ford: Which only only benefits me. And and yeah, I I can drink a lot, I mean, I owned a bar for 10 years, and I was there 17 HA day, and I drink to just keep going and

104
00:09:34.964 --> 00:09:40.460
Stacey Ford: so that eventually would have killed me. That's the best thing that happened to me is the losing the bar.

105
00:09:41.870 --> 00:09:48.609
Stacey Ford: So it can only help me. And so I mean I people could. People probably say that I drink a lot.

106
00:09:48.630 --> 00:09:49.710
Stacey Ford: And

107
00:09:50.010 --> 00:09:59.290
Stacey Ford: now I really just don't have a desire to, because I see what it's done to my brother, and how he badly he wants here he has quit. He's done. He's done with all that.

108
00:09:59.668 --> 00:10:03.489
Stacey Ford: The cocaine. Not yet. He doesn't want to give that up, so

109
00:10:03.932 --> 00:10:12.639
Stacey Ford: so this hopefully will give me a lot of insight and help him get through stuff and then on top of it, help me with my drinking.

110
00:10:13.740 --> 00:10:42.619
Stacey Ford: I don't want to quit, but I definitely need to slow down. I could drink. I could drink easily, especially in Florida, because it's sunny every day. I have a pool. I live in the ocean. It's easy to have a Margarita every day, or a winer. I mean, it's it's just. It's so happy, and it just goes hand in hand, you know. It's so easy. But here in Chicago it's miserable. It's cold, you know, I and I don't want to go outside and smoke cigarettes. So if I drink, I'm gonna have to go outside and smoke cigarettes.

111
00:10:43.040 --> 00:11:04.910
Stacey Ford: So that helps me. So that's where I'm at my goal was to try to get my daughter is not speaking to me, and she's an adult. I have 3 grandkids and I have not had any communication, any response from her at all. She had me blocked on Facebook and everything, and it was from my

112
00:11:05.050 --> 00:11:08.270
Stacey Ford: my relationship who I who I just left.

113
00:11:08.420 --> 00:11:11.420
Stacey Ford: and I want her to know that and and

114
00:11:11.690 --> 00:11:14.424
Stacey Ford: that I'm not with him and

115
00:11:15.450 --> 00:11:22.969
Stacey Ford: I sent her so I mean I I feel like I've been talking to. I've been texting her for now we're going on 2 years.

116
00:11:22.980 --> 00:11:46.610
Stacey Ford: I think, cheers and sending the kids gifts. And I'm not getting a response or a thank you, or even I don't even know if they receive them. And they moved 3 times. And so, with that being said, I feel like I don't know if she's even reading my text or getting them at all. And I so I texted her this week, and I asked her to reply to me and let me know at least, if she's reading these. She didn't reply.

117
00:11:46.610 --> 00:12:01.264
Stacey Ford: and I just I mean, and it was a real long text, and explaining everything to, you know, talking to her and how desperately I I that's all I want in my life is her and my 3 grandkids that's the my priority and

118
00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:02.860
Stacey Ford: And then

119
00:12:03.350 --> 00:12:09.749
Stacey Ford: so I called, and it round, and it wrong. That means she doesn't have me blocked. So that's where I'm at. With that.

120
00:12:09.750 --> 00:12:13.420
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: Okay, when you you mentioned earlier about

121
00:12:13.630 --> 00:12:17.210
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: your own history with with drinking

122
00:12:17.837 --> 00:12:28.939
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: does that have anything to do with the relationship between you and your daughter? Or was it just the the individual that you were previously within a relationship? Is that why you and your daughter.

123
00:12:30.520 --> 00:12:40.300
Stacey Ford: My daughter. I did drink a lot when with with him, and he hurt me really bad and constantly, and she didn't like that, and I stayed with him.

124
00:12:40.410 --> 00:12:42.699
Stacey Ford: and so she just had enough of it.

125
00:12:43.359 --> 00:12:59.619
Stacey Ford: And he's a terrible. He cannot drink every time that he drinks something bad happens, and he usually physically attacks me or verbally attacks me one or the other, and he! He cannot drink, but he does, and I'm done with him completely.

126
00:13:00.142 --> 00:13:06.269
Stacey Ford: And I just let that go. So I want. I think that with her, knowing that.

127
00:13:06.350 --> 00:13:09.292
Stacey Ford: and that I'm not drinking like I was

128
00:13:09.910 --> 00:13:13.239
Stacey Ford: I think that that can only help, and I want her to know that.

129

Stacey Ford: I'm completely moved away, moved out, moved away, done and

138
00:13:49.510 --> 00:13:54.480
Stacey Ford: closure just done. And I was been with him for 10 years. So it's

139
00:13:55.990 --> 00:14:06.310
Stacey Ford: and I don't miss them. I'm very happy right now. I'm extremely happy, and I feel so. I feel like my life is just about to begin right now. Finally.

140
00:14:06.700 --> 00:14:11.410
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: Well, that that's great to hear, and and in in terms of your goal to connect with your daughter. You

141
00:14:11.710 --> 00:14:16.009
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: you it sounds like you attempted to reach out to her since we've last met.

142
00:14:16.050 --> 00:14:18.030
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: and that's through text. You said.

143
00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:31.429
Stacey Ford: Yes, and and then I I asked her to please tell me, are you even getting these, you know? And she didn't reply, and I called in it wrong, which before it was blocked.

144
00:14:31.500 --> 00:14:44.994
Stacey Ford: So and Facebook, I I now see that I'm we used to be. You know. Her and I were were super close. I had her when I was 17. So we're you know we're we're so close and

145
00:14:45.440 --> 00:14:47.489
Stacey Ford: she's my best friend, and

146
00:14:48.100 --> 00:14:52.589
Stacey Ford: it just. I don't know what to do at this point, but I lost my thought.

147
00:14:53.348 --> 00:14:56.389
Stacey Ford: I don't remember. What what was I getting at?

148
00:14:56.590 --> 00:14:57.690
Stacey Ford: I'm sorry.

149
00:14:57.690 --> 00:15:04.449
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: No, that that's fine. I I think last week or last time we met I used that example of

150
00:15:04.830 --> 00:15:05.425
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: of

151
00:15:07.010 --> 00:15:14.090
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: putting on your own face mask when you're in. Hopefully, none of you are in a situation where airplane is going around going down, or any of those things.

152
00:15:15.100 --> 00:15:20.692
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: They always tell you to put your own face mask on before you help someone else.

153
00:15:21.470 --> 00:15:25.089
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: What are some things that you're thinking about

154
00:15:25.460 --> 00:15:29.180
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: that will be most beneficial for you, you know, as you

155
00:15:29.250 --> 00:15:34.010
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: help your brother and recover on your own, and do those things. What are some things that you're thinking about.

156
00:15:34.560 --> 00:15:39.000
Stacey Ford: Well come to the conclusion. Sorry.

157
00:15:39.050 --> 00:15:58.823
Stacey Ford: Come to the conclusion that I was. I'm on this earth to help other people. I think I believe that that's just what I do. I love helping people, and I'm always offering to help. And actually, probably 2 people say that I offer too much. It's kind of annoying. Maybe my brother says that especially. But

158
00:15:59.240 --> 00:16:09.959
Stacey Ford: that's just what I do. And so I'm gonna try to just focus on myself. And you know I've always put everything into everyone else.

159
00:16:09.980 --> 00:16:11.070
Stacey Ford: and

160
00:16:11.450 --> 00:16:22.260
Stacey Ford: my life revolved on everyone else's lives or helping take care of everybody else. And I've had some fatal accidents with both my parents who have passed and helped them, and

161
00:16:22.350 --> 00:16:26.510
Stacey Ford: a couple of my sisters, because I have 11 siblings. So

162
00:16:26.590 --> 00:16:32.889
Stacey Ford: couple of my girl, my sisters, that have passed, and things like that that you know.

163
00:16:33.280 --> 00:16:54.249
Stacey Ford: So now I'm right. Now I am focusing on myself and my my beautiful little 2 dogs and getting a relationship with my daughter, and in the process, just bettering myself. Make as much money as I can, and get back. Get to the life that I you know that I really want so.

164
00:16:54.250 --> 00:16:59.909
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: Okay, we'll put again. Put that in the bike rack, and we'll talk about that a little bit later

165
00:17:01.520 --> 00:17:04.970
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: autumn, or Shannon. How? How was your week who would like to go next.

166
00:17:04.970 --> 00:17:05.660
Stacey Ford: 6.

167
00:17:08.470 --> 00:17:09.760
Autumn S: I'll go ahead.

168
00:17:10.300 --> 00:17:12.833
Autumn S: I was supposed to get a therapist and

169
00:17:13.710 --> 00:17:18.899
Autumn S: I have not gotten a full time therapist, but I did see

170
00:17:19.089 --> 00:17:24.460
Autumn S: my daughter. She's like a mental health. Nurse, practitioner.

171
00:17:25.023 --> 00:17:33.606
Autumn S: I saw her last week, and it went really good. We met for like 2 h, and we talked about everything, and I feel like

172
00:17:34.800 --> 00:17:37.369
Autumn S: At 1st I always felt guilty about like.

173
00:17:37.570 --> 00:17:43.819
Autumn S: because I have my middle daughter. That's not talking to me. So I felt guilty because I

174
00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:48.800
Autumn S: I didn't feel like I wanted to be okay.

175
00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:52.290
Autumn S: I don't know if you understand that it's like

176
00:17:52.650 --> 00:17:58.669
Autumn S: if my middle daughter was not talking to me. I felt like I didn't. I couldn't be okay, like

177
00:18:00.070 --> 00:18:06.610
Autumn S: I needed to be sad about that. I needed to be down about that. But you know I just decided that.

178
00:18:07.260 --> 00:18:08.930
Autumn S: You know it's not.

179
00:18:09.690 --> 00:18:11.420
Autumn S: I've done everything I can.

180
00:18:11.670 --> 00:18:15.250
Autumn S: I have apologize to her. I've

181
00:18:15.746 --> 00:18:23.400
Autumn S: reached out to her. I've given her presents. I've I've done everything that I can do. And I finally just got to the point where

182
00:18:24.210 --> 00:18:28.300
Autumn S: I'm okay, because if she doesn't

183
00:18:28.460 --> 00:18:30.410
Autumn S: want to be in my life.

184
00:18:31.250 --> 00:18:38.289
Autumn S: Then that's her decision, because I feel like everything's on her now.

185
00:18:38.780 --> 00:18:40.710
Autumn S: you know it's her move, and

186
00:18:40.850 --> 00:18:43.070
Autumn S: if I've done everything I can that

187
00:18:43.160 --> 00:18:48.449
Autumn S: I need to be happy with the people that do want to be around me and in my life.

188
00:18:48.880 --> 00:18:53.660
Autumn S: So I kind of come to that conclusion last week with

189
00:18:54.580 --> 00:18:56.610
Autumn S: with my nurse practitioner, we just.

190
00:18:57.050 --> 00:19:02.319
Autumn S: And and she said, You know, that's okay, because I don't have to just

191
00:19:02.610 --> 00:19:07.629
Autumn S: continue to reach out to someone who rejects me again and again.

192
00:19:08.030 --> 00:19:12.999
Autumn S: That was making me really sad and not able to cope.

193
00:19:13.850 --> 00:19:16.430
Autumn S: So that's that's what I've done.

194
00:19:17.510 --> 00:19:20.630
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: And so when you, when you met with your

195
00:19:20.960 --> 00:19:27.420
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: healthcare, now clarified it, you did you meet with your therapist, or was it a healthcare provider.

196
00:19:27.420 --> 00:19:41.599
Autumn S: She does therapy. But she she she is a therapist. She doesn't do it anymore. She's like the nurse practitioner that diagnoses. But still, we have like 2 h sessions every time I see her.

197
00:19:41.880 --> 00:19:43.680
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: So often. Do you see her.

198
00:19:44.382 --> 00:19:46.799
Autumn S: Well, I was seeing her like

199
00:19:47.740 --> 00:19:55.779
Autumn S: this time. I saw her like monthly, but now it's like every 3 months, because you know the little forms that you fill out where

200
00:19:55.860 --> 00:19:59.000
Autumn S: it tells you how depressed you are and what

201
00:19:59.030 --> 00:20:01.759
Autumn S: well, I was like. I was like a 12

202
00:20:02.368 --> 00:20:08.130
Autumn S: and last week, when I filled it out, I was so excited because I was a 4.

203
00:20:08.190 --> 00:20:15.410
Autumn S: So yeah, the medication she's given me is helping, too. So yeah.

204
00:20:16.470 --> 00:20:23.710
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: So it sounds like as you look at your your own health. That

205
00:20:24.460 --> 00:20:29.379
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: that focus to continue working on yourself is a really good thing right now is that

206
00:20:29.660 --> 00:20:31.350
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: is that what I'm hearing.

207
00:20:31.350 --> 00:20:32.886
Autumn S: Yes, and I started

208
00:20:33.320 --> 00:20:35.680
Autumn S: I'm learning to crochet.

209
00:20:35.970 --> 00:20:48.019
Autumn S: and and that keeps my hands busy. It keeps me busy, and my mind, it's like I have to think about what I'm doing. So it's not like my mind is flooded with all the bad thoughts and all the sad things, and

210
00:20:48.440 --> 00:20:49.639
Autumn S: it helps.

211
00:20:50.950 --> 00:20:54.850
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: Well, that that's great to hear, and and good work over the last 2 weeks. Autumn.

212
00:20:55.260 --> 00:20:55.790
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: Thank you.

213
00:20:55.790 --> 00:21:01.499
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: All right, Shannon. Would you like to to go next, and then and then, Matthew.

214
00:21:10.250 --> 00:21:12.070
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: you're on mute, Shannon. There you are.

215
00:21:12.070 --> 00:21:14.675
Shannon: Yeah. Sorry.

216
00:21:15.720 --> 00:21:19.459
Shannon: Let's see my goal. I was pretty much

217
00:21:20.610 --> 00:21:26.020
Shannon: at least, I think. I I will. I wish to relocate, you know.

218
00:21:26.480 --> 00:21:30.729
Shannon: with my husband away from the area that I'm in.

219
00:21:30.940 --> 00:21:37.250
Shannon: because I feel that it would be best to have a fresh start and and

220
00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:41.595
Shannon: I'm moving towards that goal. We have somebody that

221
00:21:42.190 --> 00:21:47.860
Shannon: is renting our house. So we're trying to find a place to to go. Really,

222
00:21:52.700 --> 00:21:59.809
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: So are you living in the the same place when we talked the last time? Are you living in that same place, or have you moved since then?

223
00:22:00.590 --> 00:22:04.369
Shannon: Yeah, well, really, we have a, we have sort of a

224
00:22:04.670 --> 00:22:08.530
Shannon: kind of apartment outside of our house. So we're just trying to move

225
00:22:08.900 --> 00:22:14.349
Shannon: from our where where we are just out there, for right now, until we find the place.

226
00:22:14.710 --> 00:22:15.490
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: Okay.

227
00:22:15.700 --> 00:22:19.720

230
00:22:23.990 --> 00:22:29.919
Shannon: I'm moving forward, but well, I am. But I'm still kind of like.

231
00:22:31.130 --> 00:22:36.420
Shannon: I don't know if my husband's really being honest with me and wanting to.

232
00:22:39.230 --> 00:22:41.810
Shannon: I don't really believe them so.

233
00:22:42.710 --> 00:22:45.129
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: To to quit. I remember the the last time.

234
00:22:45.130 --> 00:22:47.080
Shannon: Quit using drugs. Yeah.

235
00:22:47.080 --> 00:22:50.439
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: You were. When when is the last time that you've used.

236
00:22:52.159 --> 00:22:52.839
Shannon: Today.

237
00:22:52.840 --> 00:22:58.700
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: Okay, was there, and and you mentioned a fresh start would be sort of

238
00:23:00.350 --> 00:23:04.740
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: and and remind me, do you?

239
00:23:06.740 --> 00:23:11.380
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: Who are the connections in your life right now, or the relationships that you

240
00:23:12.780 --> 00:23:18.179
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: have are those helpful as you try to quit? Or is that why you're looking for the fresh start is that you really don't

241
00:23:19.320 --> 00:23:21.300
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: like the group you're involved with now.

242
00:23:22.430 --> 00:23:25.849
Shannon: Yeah, I don't like anybody, really, that I'm involved with. Now.

243
00:23:25.980 --> 00:23:29.490
Shannon: we don't have any friends, just people who use us. And

244
00:23:30.680 --> 00:23:34.119
Shannon: I really just want to live a sober and happy life. I just

245
00:23:34.530 --> 00:23:40.539
Shannon: you know I love my husband. We've been together for 14 years, and I

246
00:23:40.590 --> 00:23:46.240
Shannon: I want to try and work things out with him, so I'm still here. But

247
00:23:48.210 --> 00:23:54.115
Shannon: Sometimes I feel like I I really shouldn't be here anyways.

248
00:23:55.830 --> 00:23:56.470
Shannon: Like.

249
00:23:57.240 --> 00:24:00.879
Shannon: I don't really have any like family here. It's his family

250
00:24:02.460 --> 00:24:05.840
Shannon: mostly his mom, and she takes care of her boys right now.

251
00:24:06.740 --> 00:24:07.250
Shannon: But

252
00:24:08.010 --> 00:24:08.590
Matthew Warner: I'm.

253
00:24:08.930 --> 00:24:09.540
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: So when you.

254
00:24:09.540 --> 00:24:16.360
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: when you say you shouldn't be here, are you referring to your relationship right now? You shouldn't be in that relationship.

255
00:24:16.710 --> 00:24:18.100
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: You shouldn't be in this.

256
00:24:18.100 --> 00:24:20.099
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: It's like, what are what are you referring to?

257
00:24:20.670 --> 00:24:26.030
Shannon: I just don't want. I just don't really want to be in the drug life anymore. I just.

258
00:24:26.710 --> 00:24:33.600
Shannon: But it's it's kind of it's I know it's my choice for using. But it's kind of like.

259
00:24:34.380 --> 00:24:38.310
Shannon: yeah. Oh, if he's gonna bring it around, then I'm gonna do it, even though I don't want to.

260
00:24:38.880 --> 00:24:43.159
Shannon: you know. It's just, I guess, part of being an addict. Really.

261
00:24:44.130 --> 00:24:45.590
Shannon: Are there any.

262
00:24:46.616 --> 00:24:50.769
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: People in your life. And I'm thinking, healthcare providers. I'm thinking of

263
00:24:51.565 --> 00:24:55.919
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: organizations. Is there anyone that you can reach out to to

264
00:24:56.200 --> 00:25:01.960
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: talk about your situation, and begin to to make some of those adjustments for you.

265
00:25:04.560 --> 00:25:06.580
Shannon: Not really that I can think of.

266
00:25:08.690 --> 00:25:09.560
Shannon: I'm.

267
00:25:09.560 --> 00:25:11.330
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: Do you have a healthcare provider right now?

268
00:25:12.460 --> 00:25:13.750
Shannon: Well, I do.

269
00:25:14.960 --> 00:25:20.729
Shannon: I mean I could reach out to the rehab that I went to, and they probably

270
00:25:20.770 --> 00:25:29.519
Shannon: could help me with something, because, you know, I graduated the program back in mid June.

271
00:25:30.930 --> 00:25:37.030
Shannon: and they, you know, they provide you with like alumni information.

272
00:25:37.620 --> 00:25:42.069
Shannon: I think it would have been best if I had chose to go to like sober living

273
00:25:42.460 --> 00:25:46.819
Shannon: after I left there, and I didn't, even though I knew better. But.

274
00:25:48.080 --> 00:25:50.670
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: Is there? Is there still an opportunity to do that?

275
00:25:51.210 --> 00:25:52.210
Shannon: To

276
00:25:52.850 --> 00:25:53.890
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: Program like that.

277
00:25:55.250 --> 00:25:59.730
Shannon: I don't think so. I think if if I was gonna do it, it would have had been like

278
00:26:00.280 --> 00:26:02.350
Shannon: within the 1st few weeks.

279
00:26:03.290 --> 00:26:07.450
Shannon: I don't know. I I could reach out to them and and find out what I could do.

280
00:26:08.490 --> 00:26:15.520
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: Is that a a goal you're really interested in is to to take that initial step and and

281
00:26:16.090 --> 00:26:23.470
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: reach out to someone is that achievable for you. Is is there any barriers that get in the way of you reaching out to look after your own health?

282
00:26:25.030 --> 00:26:25.900
Shannon: Hmm!

283
00:26:28.840 --> 00:26:32.309
Shannon: I mean, it's something that I could do.

284
00:26:32.750 --> 00:26:40.550
Shannon: But I can't really like I'm kind of like stuck where I'm at until we

285
00:26:41.450 --> 00:26:44.419
Shannon: both me and my husband moved somewhere else, so.

286
00:26:46.260 --> 00:26:46.840
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: But it.

287
00:26:46.840 --> 00:26:47.410
Shannon: I mean.

288
00:26:47.410 --> 00:26:54.590
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: You could. Could you reach out to a healthcare provider and and make an appointment? Even if your husband and you are still living together. Could you

289
00:26:54.710 --> 00:26:55.750
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: do something like that.

290
00:26:56.590 --> 00:26:58.279
Shannon: Yeah, I could do that.

291
00:26:59.950 --> 00:27:03.909
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: Put the again. Let's put this conversation in the bike rack, and we'll

292
00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:06.069
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: we'll take a deeper dive here in a little bit.

293
00:27:07.060 --> 00:27:07.730
Shannon: Sure.

294
00:27:08.290 --> 00:27:12.620
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: Before we do that, Matthew, do you prefer Matthew or Matt?

295
00:27:14.719 --> 00:27:15.080
Matthew Warner: Matt.

296
00:27:15.080 --> 00:27:18.320
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: Okay, Matt, all right. How are you? How's everything going.

297
00:27:18.590 --> 00:27:21.200
Matthew Warner: I'm good, that's I apologize for being late.

298
00:27:21.490 --> 00:27:24.809
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: No, that's so. That's okay. It's good to see you. I

299
00:27:24.960 --> 00:27:27.479
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: I made a note to make sure.

300
00:27:27.630 --> 00:27:33.244
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: I'm glad you put Matt up there instead of Kenneth again. But I'd made a note just in case

301
00:27:33.730 --> 00:27:37.520
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: alright! How's how's everything for you? This is this would be your.

302
00:27:37.870 --> 00:27:42.499
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: I guess, 1st holiday season since treatment. Is that correct?

303
00:27:44.199 --> 00:27:46.579
Matthew Warner: We had our 1st Thanksgiving silver together.

304
00:27:46.950 --> 00:27:49.189
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: And how was that? It was amazing.

305
00:27:49.200 --> 00:27:50.390
Matthew Warner: It was amazing.

306
00:27:51.110 --> 00:27:54.899
Matthew Warner: I never realized how what what we missed. You know.

307
00:27:56.040 --> 00:27:57.200
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: Well so, but.

308
00:27:57.200 --> 00:27:59.219
Matthew Warner: It was. It was an experience.

309
00:27:59.590 --> 00:28:05.939
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: That's great. Tell us. Tell us more about it. What was it like compared to other Thanksgivings? What did you get to do this time

310
00:28:05.970 --> 00:28:08.020
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: that you hadn't been able to before.

311
00:28:12.580 --> 00:28:19.149
Matthew Warner: Well, we cooked together. We made a ham, and we just cooked the whole day and the night before.

312
00:28:19.240 --> 00:28:25.059
Matthew Warner: and we've never done that. It was always drug using. And and that was the most important thing.

313
00:28:25.070 --> 00:28:35.509
Matthew Warner: What's the use of drugs, you know, and it's it's awesome. Then, when the drugs ain't in there, and we get to spend quality time together and cook and make memories

314
00:28:35.550 --> 00:28:39.810
Matthew Warner: and put up our Christmas tree. You know it was it? Just

315
00:28:40.030 --> 00:28:43.140
Matthew Warner: it was awesome. That's the only word I can come up with.

316
00:28:43.720 --> 00:28:45.000
Matthew Warner: The happiest.

317
00:28:45.170 --> 00:28:50.459
Matthew Warner: One of the happiest moments of my life to this point is, is being able to do that sober.

318
00:28:50.590 --> 00:28:51.930
Matthew Warner: And and

319
00:28:52.120 --> 00:28:57.919
Matthew Warner: I can't thank the people enough where I went to treatment, you know, and they say that I don't give myself enough credit.

320
00:28:58.260 --> 00:29:02.330
Matthew Warner: because, you know, I took the 1st step, and

321
00:29:02.550 --> 00:29:06.590
Matthew Warner: and my advice to everybody else is, you have to take the 1st step

322
00:29:06.810 --> 00:29:12.060
Matthew Warner: you know you have to. You have to do that in order for you to get better and and

323
00:29:13.580 --> 00:29:19.650
Matthew Warner: do that experience sobriety, you know I mean unhappy.

324
00:29:20.670 --> 00:29:24.430
Matthew Warner: I didn't know what happy was y'all, and that's the truth.

325
00:29:25.370 --> 00:29:28.120
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: Was there anyone there anyone that you got.

326
00:29:28.190 --> 00:29:29.759
Matthew Warner: That was my Thanksgiving.

327
00:29:30.160 --> 00:29:36.850
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: That's that's fantastic. Was there anyone there that you got a chance to reconnect with that? You hadn't for a long time.

328
00:29:38.820 --> 00:29:50.539
Matthew Warner: Well, we had our Thanksgiving together privately on Thanksgiving, and then on Saturday we went to my dad and Mom's house, and that's the 1st Thanksgiving we ever went there because of the drug use.

329
00:29:50.770 --> 00:29:55.979
Matthew Warner: and it was awesome, you know. I mean, they cooked for us on Saturday, so we had 2 Thanksgivings.

330
00:29:56.430 --> 00:29:59.309
Matthew Warner: It was great, I mean it was great.

331
00:30:00.710 --> 00:30:01.250
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: That's.

332
00:30:01.250 --> 00:30:04.140
Matthew Warner: So I've had a real good, real good week

333
00:30:04.540 --> 00:30:11.769
Matthew Warner: last week, and this week it just seems the more time we get sober the the better things are getting.

334
00:30:11.890 --> 00:30:13.180
Matthew Warner: Just to be honest.

335
00:30:14.360 --> 00:30:15.209
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: You mentioned that.

336
00:30:15.210 --> 00:30:15.990
Matthew Warner: To me that.

337
00:30:17.220 --> 00:30:19.310
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: You mentioned sort of that 1st step

338
00:30:19.760 --> 00:30:28.100
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: that you took. What was that that moment for you when you decided I really need to do something.

339
00:30:28.250 --> 00:30:28.850
Matthew Warner: So

340
00:30:32.220 --> 00:30:39.760
Matthew Warner: I had been high so long that that I didn't know up or down, really, and

341
00:30:40.750 --> 00:30:45.840
Matthew Warner: my my woman was already in treatment because she was court ordered to go.

342
00:30:46.640 --> 00:30:55.070
Matthew Warner: and I didn't. You know I got to thinking about it, and I'm like, well, if she's going and she's going to be sober when she gets out.

343
00:30:55.280 --> 00:30:56.760
Matthew Warner: Then then

344
00:30:56.970 --> 00:31:02.380
Matthew Warner: the only way that she's going to have a chance is if I put the effort forth to get sober.

345
00:31:02.600 --> 00:31:05.539
Matthew Warner: so I checked myself into the same rehab she was in.

346
00:31:06.660 --> 00:31:11.709
Matthew Warner: and and that was the initial step that I took. I didn't. I've done it more for

347
00:31:11.950 --> 00:31:16.740
Matthew Warner: us as a couple to be honest, because I didn't want her to get out.

348
00:31:16.830 --> 00:31:21.780
Matthew Warner: And maybe the reason that she relapsed I couldn't. You know I've done that

349
00:31:22.730 --> 00:31:30.559
Matthew Warner: and past relationships. And they didn't want to do drugs. And I done drugs. And it ended badly. And I didn't want to do that again.

350
00:31:31.400 --> 00:31:34.819
Matthew Warner: So I got 3 ex-wives, and you know.

351
00:31:36.290 --> 00:31:41.439
Matthew Warner: at 50 years old, and I didn't want to ruin this one with drug use, just to be honest.

352
00:31:42.800 --> 00:31:45.090
Matthew Warner: So that's my 1st step.

353
00:31:46.790 --> 00:31:51.750
Matthew Warner: and I called the rehab and I called around. I didn't want to go to one that didn't have the mats.

354
00:31:52.290 --> 00:31:58.179
Matthew Warner: because I'm 50 years old, and I've done drugs since I was 15,

355
00:31:58.810 --> 00:32:07.549
Matthew Warner: and I didn't think, and I still don't know if I'll ever be off the mats. To be honest, you know I get a shot a monthly shot called Brick Saudi.

356
00:32:08.080 --> 00:32:11.999
Matthew Warner: and that's what gets me through. To be honest.

357
00:32:12.420 --> 00:32:18.750
Matthew Warner: you know I don't crave drugs because of it. I don't want drugs, and and that's

358
00:32:19.680 --> 00:32:25.099
Matthew Warner: that. And the effort that I put forth in the 90 day treatment 98 days, I was in treatment.

359
00:32:26.420 --> 00:32:27.310
Matthew Warner: So.

360
00:32:28.340 --> 00:32:34.770
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: Just to go back to Shannon for a little bit. Is Shannon. Is anything Matt saying.

361
00:32:35.050 --> 00:32:36.699
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: resonating with you right now.

362
00:32:44.640 --> 00:32:47.060
Shannon: Yeah, I mean, oh.

363
00:32:50.800 --> 00:32:51.775
Shannon: I'm I'm just

364
00:32:52.590 --> 00:32:57.079
Shannon: I I think so. I mean, I agree with a lot of what he says. So

365
00:32:58.810 --> 00:33:01.983
Shannon: I'm not the best at explaining things, though.

366
00:33:02.590 --> 00:33:13.899
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: That's okay. We'll we'll take a a deeper dive here in a little bit. Thank you for all of you for sharing and giving us sort of a a debrief of your your goals from the last time we met.

367
00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:20.020
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: During just one reminder before we get started with the the rest of this session I

371
00:33:37.270 --> 00:33:38.480
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: And then

372
00:33:39.020 --> 00:33:47.740
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: with that, this week, we're really thinking of our own health. Last last week we really excuse me. 2 weeks ago, we really focused on relationships. And this week it's more about

373
00:33:47.890 --> 00:33:53.409
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: our own health and and how we can really help one another

374
00:33:53.820 --> 00:33:59.089
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: to achieve our our most optimal health, and whether that's our physical health or our mental health.

375
00:34:00.040 --> 00:34:03.155
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: and we and we do that by by

376
00:34:03.770 --> 00:34:11.039
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: setting some setting some goals and so with that Revetra, I would I would like to start with you. Since

377
00:34:11.110 --> 00:34:17.670
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: we didn't get a chance to connect a couple of weeks ago. But when you think about your

378
00:34:17.880 --> 00:34:18.890
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: own health.

379
00:34:20.159 --> 00:34:23.079
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: What might be one thing that you want to make.

380
00:34:23.080 --> 00:34:23.870
Ravettra Ford: Progress.

381
00:34:23.870 --> 00:34:24.409
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: On.

382
00:34:24.760 --> 00:34:26.260
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: What does that look like for you.

383
00:34:27.987 --> 00:34:34.059
Ravettra Ford: In regards to my own health.

384
00:34:35.734 --> 00:34:43.180
Ravettra Ford: What I re what I started doing was doubling up

385
00:34:45.730 --> 00:34:50.529
Ravettra Ford: with my on some like my prescription drugs.

386
00:34:51.020 --> 00:35:02.560
Ravettra Ford: ibuprofen, even though, like I knew, like I was only supposed to take like. At 1st I was taking. It is prescribed with my ibuprofen

387
00:35:02.980 --> 00:35:07.000
Ravettra Ford: for my Oco arthritis. So it's like the pain

388
00:35:07.160 --> 00:35:15.439
Ravettra Ford: opioids or pain medication for me, or inflammation, or like I would take it, and I would take, like the arthritis.

389
00:35:16.324 --> 00:35:19.949
Ravettra Ford: Tylenol for arthritis. Pain. 8 h.

390
00:35:21.770 --> 00:35:26.219
Ravettra Ford: Oh, I'm sorry. My screen! Hold on! Can you hear me?

391
00:35:26.300 --> 00:35:27.679
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: Yes, we can hear you.

392
00:35:29.200 --> 00:35:30.890
Ravettra Ford: Okay, so.

393
00:35:30.890 --> 00:35:35.899
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: I can see your silhouette. It looks a little bit like you're in the Witness Protection program, but we can see a little bit of you in there.

394
00:35:37.613 --> 00:35:46.809
Ravettra Ford: Okay. So I have a younger brother. We're 10 years apart, my mom. She's his caregiver.

395
00:35:48.310 --> 00:35:51.060
Ravettra Ford: And I assist her when I can.

396
00:35:51.575 --> 00:35:52.879
Ravettra Ford: So he didn't

397
00:35:52.890 --> 00:36:20.009
Ravettra Ford: do his diabetes like he should, so I step in when I could to help her with him, getting to his doctors and everything, and they mentioned like for him he could take like 2 of something, so I don't know. I got a hold to that and put it in my head. And I'm like, Oh, yeah, if I double up on this or that, and it may help me feel better, or I could use it in my capacity.

398
00:36:20.160 --> 00:36:39.510
Ravettra Ford: and not really, you know, talking with the pharmacist or talking with my doctor, so a goal of mine is to get back on track with that before I try to go up and up, and before I know it, I'm like

399
00:36:40.740 --> 00:36:57.540
Ravettra Ford: so far away from my prescribed dose to where it's like gotten ridiculous. So that's the goal of mine is to get back my try to my original prescribed dosage of my medication.

400
00:36:57.970 --> 00:37:00.400
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: So you decided to double up. You made

401
00:37:00.600 --> 00:37:02.810
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: that decision on your own to to go ahead.

402
00:37:02.810 --> 00:37:17.769
Ravettra Ford: Totally on my own, and I knew in my mind I was not supposed to be doing that, otherwise they wouldn't give you a label when you pick it up from the pharmacist along with the little pamphlet or booklet.

403
00:37:19.170 --> 00:37:20.870
Ravettra Ford: And so that's what. Oh.

404
00:37:20.870 --> 00:37:27.460
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: Was there anything that happened you you mentioned? Was it your brother? You said you were

405
00:37:27.970 --> 00:37:31.040
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: caring for someone with diabetes.

406
00:37:31.150 --> 00:37:33.946
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: Who who is that your was it

407
00:37:35.470 --> 00:37:41.179
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: Was it that? Or was there some other something else that happened where you felt you had to double up.

408
00:37:42.030 --> 00:37:47.449
Ravettra Ford: Well, it it was what I was going through.

409
00:37:48.197 --> 00:37:50.080
Ravettra Ford: As well. And

410
00:37:50.912 --> 00:38:01.759
Ravettra Ford: my mom's fiance. Okay, so this is the thing. One of my conditions I I suffer from already is osteoarthritis.

411
00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:15.839
Ravettra Ford: So he recognized me. He saw me walking one day, and he asked me, Did I? Has I? He said, do you have gout? And I was like no, not that I I was never diagnosed with it.

412
00:38:16.030 --> 00:38:21.199
Ravettra Ford: and so that it when someone asks me a question

413
00:38:21.440 --> 00:38:25.950
Ravettra Ford: like it may not do anything to me right away.

414
00:38:26.430 --> 00:38:33.750
Ravettra Ford: However, like later on, I may think about it again, and then it will start resonating. And

415
00:38:33.760 --> 00:38:44.169
Ravettra Ford: you know, in my brain, and then I'll it'll make me want to look it up, and then I'll start thinking like, well, maybe, could I have? So that.

416
00:38:44.430 --> 00:38:54.000
Ravettra Ford: coupled along with the my little brother's caregiver, I mean not caregivers, the medical providers giving him authorization.

417
00:38:54.010 --> 00:38:56.400
Ravettra Ford: Those 2 things

418
00:38:56.730 --> 00:39:08.740
Ravettra Ford: combined together, I'm like, but maybe I could have Gap. Maybe that's what I was hurting for. So if I they told him he could double up so maybe that could be well, not double up. That's his dose.

419
00:39:09.010 --> 00:39:23.240
Ravettra Ford: and maybe they mean it must be. This could be safe, so it may not be able to be harmful. So maybe I can do that, and maybe it could assist me with my condition.

420
00:39:23.760 --> 00:39:24.830
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: How long have you.

421
00:39:24.900 --> 00:39:27.199
Ravettra Ford: How long have you been doubling up for?

422
00:39:29.942 --> 00:39:34.500
Ravettra Ford: So now I've been doubling up.

423
00:39:36.580 --> 00:39:51.240
Ravettra Ford: I suppose it's been about a month now, but now I stopped because I was just recently in the hospital, even over Thanksgiving Break. So I was just discharged just fresh as of last night.

424
00:39:51.430 --> 00:40:07.079
Ravettra Ford: so I wasn't able to, of course, do it in there, because they're going to do everything they have to scan your bracelet, your arm bracelet every time. So you're on a strict of what it says by the book

425
00:40:07.220 --> 00:40:09.400
Ravettra Ford: of your prescribed

426
00:40:10.504 --> 00:40:20.180
Ravettra Ford: of which the medical provider has before so just was prior to that. That's what I was on my own trying with the doubling up so.

427
00:40:20.490 --> 00:40:23.869
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: So you're back to taking your medication.

428
00:40:24.623 --> 00:40:31.650
Ravettra Ford: Yes, it because and then, by the way, yes, I did have gal on top of mine.

429
00:40:31.960 --> 00:40:35.439
Ravettra Ford: Oco arthritis. So the thing of it is

430
00:40:35.510 --> 00:40:41.089
Ravettra Ford: now is just gonna be a challenge for me and trying to. I'm gonna see?

431
00:40:41.250 --> 00:40:46.920
Ravettra Ford: Yeah, if this is going to work, I'm gonna try my best like, I said. I know this says Go.

432
00:40:46.980 --> 00:40:50.100
Ravettra Ford: and that's what I'm gonna try to make it.

433
00:40:50.620 --> 00:40:55.749
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: When is your next meeting with your healthcare provider, or your follow up, so to speak.

434
00:40:56.310 --> 00:40:59.560
Ravettra Ford: Okay. I tried to call in today

435
00:40:59.690 --> 00:41:18.449
Ravettra Ford: because they told me to make one according to my discharge instructions in the folder Asap. Within one week, however, they they were closed the 1st Wednesday of each month I found out on today. So I have to call on tomorrow to make the appointment.

436
00:41:19.440 --> 00:41:23.929
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: So really, you're at the forefront of your mind is to make that

437
00:41:24.220 --> 00:41:26.470
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: call to your healthcare provider to.

438
00:41:28.930 --> 00:41:31.069
Ravettra Ford: That's my priority. Yeah.

439
00:41:31.070 --> 00:41:32.520
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: Moving in the right direction.

440
00:41:33.190 --> 00:41:41.250
Ravettra Ford: On track and in the proper direction, because I don't want that off track.

441
00:41:41.880 --> 00:41:48.620
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: Besides scheduling, and all of that? Or is there any other? Are there any other barriers that would

442
00:41:49.120 --> 00:41:53.230
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: get in the way of you making that appointment 1st thing tomorrow.

443
00:41:56.050 --> 00:42:06.050
Ravettra Ford: No, and being that, I'll I'll leave have, like I have the folder right here

444
00:42:06.350 --> 00:42:15.110
Ravettra Ford: long as it's fresh and in my face, and normally like health, wise.

445
00:42:15.360 --> 00:42:22.649
Ravettra Ford: If I usually make that a real like a true priority of mine.

446
00:42:23.080 --> 00:42:26.669
Ravettra Ford: I I'll usually be good with that. But like

447
00:42:26.700 --> 00:42:29.540
Ravettra Ford: once it starts kind of affecting

448
00:42:29.850 --> 00:42:35.890
Ravettra Ford: my mobility. That's a different thing. Of course, I don't know how much you know about

449
00:42:36.856 --> 00:42:44.179
Ravettra Ford: arthritis and a different various variety, or different kinds, or gal, for instance.

450
00:42:44.750 --> 00:42:50.090
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: So say tomorrow morning you successfully make that appointment. How how hard I'm

451
00:42:50.380 --> 00:42:53.939
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: I! I live in a a small rural area.

452
00:42:54.652 --> 00:42:58.760
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: But I'm I'm thinking of Memphis, Tennessee, is it? Is it hard

453
00:42:59.070 --> 00:43:01.769
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: to make it to your appointment?

454
00:43:02.671 --> 00:43:08.350
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: In more of an urban area? Or is that is that easy for you to do.

455
00:43:10.010 --> 00:43:19.369
Ravettra Ford: Actually for me my primary care. My medical provider is not very far away

456
00:43:19.760 --> 00:43:27.519
Ravettra Ford: from where I live. I and it's intentional cause. I kept him for the longest.

457
00:43:28.455 --> 00:43:41.219
Ravettra Ford: because I want him primarily so. It's he's not very far away. So that's a good thing. So I don't. I can't utilize that excuse that he's too far away.

458
00:43:42.840 --> 00:43:44.069
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: Is your.

459
00:43:45.060 --> 00:43:52.760
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: I want to sound like a doctor, even though I'm not even close, not not one. But how's your pain right now? On a on a scale of one to 10. You know how.

460
00:43:52.820 --> 00:43:54.700
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: what, what is your pain like right now?

461
00:43:56.190 --> 00:44:01.329
Ravettra Ford: Okay. So since I've gotten everything plugged in

462
00:44:02.520 --> 00:44:05.220
Ravettra Ford: I still have some pain.

463
00:44:05.280 --> 00:44:09.109
Ravettra Ford: but it's not nearly as bad as what it was.

464
00:44:09.120 --> 00:44:14.130
Ravettra Ford: So I'm going to say my pain level now.

465
00:44:15.980 --> 00:44:25.039
Ravettra Ford: I'm only at about, I would say, like 4.5.

466
00:44:25.460 --> 00:44:35.469
Ravettra Ford: So there is some pain there. But it was not a consistent pain, like, let's say I'm sitting down. It's not a I don't have a throbbing pain or anything. It's like

467
00:44:35.700 --> 00:44:40.970
Ravettra Ford: if I get up now, and I start to walk. I could still feel it in my joints, and that

468
00:44:41.040 --> 00:44:46.060
Ravettra Ford: primarily, because I know that my body needs time to process

469
00:44:46.100 --> 00:44:49.530
Ravettra Ford: like the the gout. Medic medication has the right

470
00:44:49.570 --> 00:44:54.140
Ravettra Ford: really get into my joint joints. It needs time

471
00:44:54.410 --> 00:45:01.529
Ravettra Ford: to balance everything with everything. All of my other medication as well that I'm on.

472
00:45:02.160 --> 00:45:07.740
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: So you think it's it's reasonable when we get together next Wednesday, a week from today.

473
00:45:08.520 --> 00:45:16.649
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: that you'll have met with your healthcare provider and have a clear plan of action is, that is, that you think a reasonable goal for you right now.

474
00:45:17.890 --> 00:45:21.919
Ravettra Ford: I would say so, I would say so.

475
00:45:22.690 --> 00:45:37.839
Ravettra Ford: I don't. You know know what he's gonna recommend from now? Because now I was sitting here thinking about it, and I was trying to do some of the hand exercises that some of the doctor was asked

476
00:45:40.974 --> 00:45:46.270
Ravettra Ford: but like one of the things like, what would I would make me go? In the 1st place.

477
00:45:46.630 --> 00:45:54.110
Ravettra Ford: I remember they were supposed to send an occupational therapist around before I left. But I suppose maybe they weren't available.

478
00:45:54.300 --> 00:46:04.570
Ravettra Ford: So with that being said, I want to say hopefully, so

479
00:46:05.930 --> 00:46:08.990
Ravettra Ford: that I would have a good plan of action.

480
00:46:09.080 --> 00:46:19.699
Ravettra Ford: I would like to say. Normally, he does have good suggestions, and if he has to refer me out to a different or medical provider

481
00:46:19.880 --> 00:46:29.809
Ravettra Ford: who could provide me care that he's got a specialty in it, normally works out for me.

482
00:46:30.360 --> 00:46:34.330
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: Alright. Well, at the beginning of next week, Revetra, I'll look forward to hearing

483
00:46:35.040 --> 00:46:37.510
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: how how your week went with that goal.

484
00:46:37.700 --> 00:46:38.380
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: So.

485
00:46:38.380 --> 00:46:39.580
Ravettra Ford: Yes, sir.

486
00:46:39.580 --> 00:46:41.299
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: Thank you. Thank you for sharing that.

487
00:46:41.740 --> 00:46:42.960
Ravettra Ford: Yes, set.

488
00:46:43.200 --> 00:46:47.489
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: Who would? Who would like to to go next in terms of

489
00:46:48.750 --> 00:46:54.180
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: moving forward with the goal that you had made previously, or making some changes.

490
00:46:55.440 --> 00:46:57.310
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: What does everyone have on their minds?

491
00:46:57.330 --> 00:46:58.850
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: Anyone can go next.

492
00:46:59.740 --> 00:47:01.330
Christian: Hi! It's Christian again.

493
00:47:06.210 --> 00:47:12.590
Christian: I have to motivate, and this and this commitment will help me do that.

494
00:47:12.710 --> 00:47:15.109
Christian: I am so sedentary.

495
00:47:15.480 --> 00:47:17.170
Christian: It hurts to sit.

496
00:47:18.090 --> 00:47:23.229
Christian: And so I need to stretch and kind of

497
00:47:23.430 --> 00:47:26.060
Christian: take care of my physical self.

498
00:47:28.800 --> 00:47:30.549
Christian: I mean, if I go out.

499
00:47:30.760 --> 00:47:34.789
Christian: you know and do some basic gardening chore.

500
00:47:35.360 --> 00:47:39.340
Christian: I'm sore for a day or 2, and it's ridiculous.

501
00:47:39.750 --> 00:47:45.110
Christian: And so I'm going to start.

502
00:47:45.400 --> 00:47:53.450
Christian: I got a little workout area in the basement, and I'm just gonna go down there and and and start stretching and working out.

503
00:47:54.820 --> 00:47:56.242
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: Christian. Tell me

504
00:47:58.390 --> 00:48:03.269
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: so so I'm guessing. North Carolina. You have a lot of really cool trees and

505
00:48:03.630 --> 00:48:07.550
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: opportunities for nature. Is it still warm enough where you can get outside or.

506
00:48:08.380 --> 00:48:13.920
Christian: It will be not this, you know, this whole country is in this Arctic thing.

507
00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:24.920
Christian: But there's also I have access to 2 gyms.

508
00:48:26.350 --> 00:48:33.305
Christian: So I mean, I could actually do that. I'll be honest, though. I'm a little concerned about

509
00:48:38.570 --> 00:48:41.760
Christian: what what's been going around, Covid.

510
00:48:43.374 --> 00:48:45.680
Christian: If I get it. I'm toast.

511
00:48:46.170 --> 00:48:47.960
Christian: It's just that simple.

512
00:48:48.430 --> 00:48:56.256
Christian: And I've gotten all my boosters and everything like that. But just 2 weeks ago, at the senior center, where I was working at man.

513
00:48:56.840 --> 00:48:58.899
Christian: It went through there like wildfire.

514
00:49:00.030 --> 00:49:09.099
Christian: And so, you know, walking the dogs when the weather turns for sure.

515
00:49:09.680 --> 00:49:13.489
Christian: But hell, I got a place 20 steps away.

516
00:49:14.560 --> 00:49:23.169
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: So how do you? How do you make that 1st step from being most, you know, somewhat sedentary to

517
00:49:23.720 --> 00:49:28.210
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: doing some physical activity? What's the motivating factor for you. There.

518
00:49:29.555 --> 00:49:33.840
Christian: The fact that I know I'll feel better.

519
00:49:34.230 --> 00:49:35.880
Christian: I'll sleep better.

520
00:49:36.360 --> 00:49:42.437
Christian: And I made a commitment to you guys

521
00:49:43.508 --> 00:49:45.810
Christian: that puts a little pressure on me.

522
00:49:46.320 --> 00:49:53.020
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: So everyone in this group you heard it right here. So we when we when we connect next week next week, you can.

523
00:49:53.610 --> 00:49:56.515
Christian: Touch my toes for you next week.

524
00:49:56.930 --> 00:50:00.529
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: So so speaking of that Christian like, what?

525
00:50:01.280 --> 00:50:03.822
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: So what does success look like for you?

526
00:50:04.530 --> 00:50:11.230
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: is that doing a a certain amount of time. Is that what? What is, what is?

527
00:50:11.230 --> 00:50:11.670
Christian: No.

528
00:50:11.670 --> 00:50:12.670
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: Look like for you.

529
00:50:12.670 --> 00:50:19.279
Christian: I have a you know, I've had both my shoulders repaired and all kinds of medical stuff.

530
00:50:19.660 --> 00:50:24.489
Christian: So once I stretch, then I can start doing

531
00:50:25.454 --> 00:50:28.059
Christian: kind of like rehab stuff again.

532
00:50:29.040 --> 00:50:31.910
Christian: And so that would be success.

533
00:50:32.180 --> 00:50:35.879
Christian: And then ultimately, I'd like to, you know, by springtime

534
00:50:36.480 --> 00:50:39.310
Christian: be able to get back golfing.

535
00:50:41.850 --> 00:50:47.540
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: And do you think becoming less sedentary will

536
00:50:48.550 --> 00:50:53.440
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: mean less opportunities to drink? Do those things go together.

537
00:50:54.610 --> 00:51:02.131
Christian: Definitely, because at this point I can sleep in as long as I want. You know, there's it's just too easy.

538
00:51:03.150 --> 00:51:05.879
Christian: If I start making commitments to myself.

539
00:51:05.940 --> 00:51:13.200
Christian: and occupy the time with healthy behavior as opposed to non-healthy behavior.

540
00:51:13.300 --> 00:51:19.240
Christian: It'll it'll lessen my desire, and

541
00:51:20.830 --> 00:51:23.100
Christian: you know I don't want to be hung over, working out.

542
00:51:24.380 --> 00:51:27.189
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: Does your significant other like to work out as well.

543
00:51:27.774 --> 00:51:32.739
Christian: She actually started probably about a month or 2 ago water aerobics.

544
00:51:34.200 --> 00:51:38.709
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: So is this, is there any physical activity that you both could do together?

545
00:51:42.280 --> 00:51:48.286
Christian: Probably, but I'm so out of shape that I I mean the the water aerobics is a

546
00:51:50.890 --> 00:51:58.580
Christian: male female class, so I mean, I could definitely get back and and get into doing that because it's great

547
00:52:00.388 --> 00:52:05.891
Christian: but I mean at this point I sink like a rock.

548
00:52:07.080 --> 00:52:09.897
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: So when we when we get together next week,

549
00:52:11.350 --> 00:52:13.969
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: And it's your turn to talk like, what?

550
00:52:14.680 --> 00:52:15.782
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: What will you

551
00:52:16.600 --> 00:52:22.060
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: What were you tell? What? What will you tell us? That you what happened? What's what's an achievable goal for you?

552
00:52:22.576 --> 00:52:31.150
Christian: What I tell you is that I have consistently started working out

553
00:52:31.740 --> 00:52:37.069
Christian: okay, because when I was working out after my shoulder got repaired.

554
00:52:37.080 --> 00:52:44.559
Christian: Of course I pushed myself too fast and it ruined it.

555
00:52:45.190 --> 00:52:48.550
Christian: So I'm gonna go slow. But I've gotta go every day. Okay.

556
00:52:50.050 --> 00:52:56.890
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: Well, let's let's put a a timeframe to it. What would, if you were! How many minutes a day.

557
00:52:58.400 --> 00:53:01.530
Christian: Oh! Between 15 and a half hour.

558
00:53:02.400 --> 00:53:05.440
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: 1515 min to 15 to 30 min.

559
00:53:05.440 --> 00:53:06.210
Christian: Correct.

560
00:53:06.210 --> 00:53:14.479
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: Okay, alright, and anything that would get in the way of of doing that.

561
00:53:18.670 --> 00:53:22.839
Christian: I can't really think of anything. No, I mean because I do it 1st thing in the morning.

562
00:53:23.470 --> 00:53:28.610
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: Okay for anyone else here who has started

563
00:53:29.350 --> 00:53:35.489
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: doing more physical activity after you've taken a break for a while, any any advice for for Christian.

564
00:53:44.410 --> 00:53:48.189
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: Okay? Alright. Well, well, thanks, Christian, and and

565
00:53:48.390 --> 00:53:51.739
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: we'll look forward to hearing how how that goes for you next week.

566
00:53:51.740 --> 00:53:52.899
Christian: Okay. Cool.

567
00:53:53.230 --> 00:53:55.779
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: All right. Who who would like to go next?

568
00:53:56.160 --> 00:53:57.990
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: Shannon Matt? Autumn.

569
00:54:03.690 --> 00:54:06.500
Matthew Warner: I? I can go. Okay. I guess

570
00:54:06.840 --> 00:54:13.000
Matthew Warner: I don't really have no like physical goals that that I can set for myself. I mean, I'm pretty healthy.

571
00:54:13.650 --> 00:54:15.750
Matthew Warner: I have to go to the dentist.

572
00:54:16.312 --> 00:54:20.639
Matthew Warner: But the quickest I can get in is the 18th of this month.

573
00:54:21.030 --> 00:54:31.729
Matthew Warner: so I'm waiting on that, and I'm really got a lot of, and that I don't want to go, because I had a terrible experience when I was in my childhood with the dentist.

574
00:54:31.980 --> 00:54:38.870
Matthew Warner: and and it my anxiety the closer the day gets the worse that it gets. Just to be honest.

575
00:54:39.460 --> 00:54:40.410
Matthew Warner: So

576
00:54:41.110 --> 00:54:46.379
Matthew Warner: maybe I can control that a little better, and not try not to think about my dentist appointment too much. But

577
00:54:46.490 --> 00:54:50.790
Matthew Warner: other than that, I'm pretty healthy. I see my doctor regularly now.

578
00:54:51.190 --> 00:54:56.130
Matthew Warner: and I got my shot in the morning at 7 30, so

579
00:54:56.330 --> 00:54:58.509
Matthew Warner: I really don't know what I can do for everybody.

580
00:54:59.860 --> 00:55:00.580
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: When you.

581
00:55:00.580 --> 00:55:02.705
Matthew Warner: Other than maintain my sobriety.

582
00:55:03.460 --> 00:55:05.109
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: So you talk about.

583
00:55:05.970 --> 00:55:10.119
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: I'm not sure of anyone who looks forward to their dentist appointment. But

584
00:55:10.150 --> 00:55:15.929
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: with being the anxiety that you talked about? Is there support that you receive.

585
00:55:16.330 --> 00:55:21.810
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: and and not just with with your dentist, but with anything that could cause anxiety

586
00:55:21.870 --> 00:55:29.285
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: in your recovery? Are there? Are you involved in any programs right now? Outpatient aftercare?

587
00:55:30.120 --> 00:55:33.159
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: any of those things that help with that.

588
00:55:33.160 --> 00:55:34.210
Matthew Warner: Yeah.

589
00:55:34.710 --> 00:55:47.730
Matthew Warner: yes, I do. I'm medicated for the anxiety because I was diagnosed when I was in the rehab. They to their mental doctor. I went, and I'm bipolar and manic, depressant and real high anxiety.

590
00:55:48.090 --> 00:55:52.010
Matthew Warner: and they medicated me, and I just seen on.

591
00:55:52.350 --> 00:55:55.370
Matthew Warner: I think it was the 25.th

592
00:55:55.550 --> 00:56:03.350
Matthew Warner: I've seen my mental health, doctor, and I don't go back until the 20 second of December.

593
00:56:04.147 --> 00:56:10.040
Matthew Warner: For that. So but that's what I do for that. I'm I'm medicated so.

594
00:56:10.500 --> 00:56:13.909
Matthew Warner: and they got me on like 9 different pills total.

595
00:56:14.260 --> 00:56:15.140
Matthew Warner: So.

596
00:56:15.550 --> 00:56:16.669
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: And if you ever need any.

597
00:56:16.670 --> 00:56:18.039
Matthew Warner: I mean, thank God!

598
00:56:19.160 --> 00:56:24.999
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: If sorry to interrupt. If you ever know any instance, who's who's who can you call to? Who's your

599
00:56:25.210 --> 00:56:29.540
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: who's your phone? A friend? Individual when you need.

600
00:56:29.540 --> 00:56:36.540
Matthew Warner: Well, I have a every Tuesday at 2 o'clock I have to go see a

601
00:56:36.710 --> 00:56:42.679
Matthew Warner: I guess he's a shrink psychiatrist or therapist or something. I go for an hour every Tuesday.

602
00:56:44.080 --> 00:56:49.779
Matthew Warner: and and I see him for an hour, and we pretty much talk about anything. His name's Larry.

603
00:56:51.660 --> 00:56:56.469
Matthew Warner: So that's what I do for that. And it's just me

604
00:56:57.160 --> 00:57:06.930
Matthew Warner: and I go every Tuesday religiously, you know. And and then I take, I take random drug screens still to help me stay sober to hold me accountable

605
00:57:07.220 --> 00:57:10.939
Matthew Warner: for my actions in my outpatient treatment.

606
00:57:11.110 --> 00:57:17.230
Matthew Warner: But they really don't do much for that at the place where I go, other than give me my mats.

607
00:57:17.360 --> 00:57:20.500
Matthew Warner: which I think is kind of crazy, but

608
00:57:20.740 --> 00:57:22.970
Matthew Warner: you know it is what that is.

609
00:57:24.000 --> 00:57:24.819
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: So at the beginning.

610
00:57:27.050 --> 00:57:27.929
Matthew Warner: Go ahead!

611
00:57:27.930 --> 00:57:29.639
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: Go ahead. What what about Larry?

612
00:57:30.887 --> 00:57:33.149
Matthew Warner: He's great. I mean, he's great

613
00:57:33.240 --> 00:57:40.650
Matthew Warner: without him. I probably couldn't get through a lot of stuff, to be honest, because he's someone that I unload everything to every Tuesday.

614
00:57:41.010 --> 00:57:41.920
Matthew Warner: so.

615
00:57:43.140 --> 00:57:47.439
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: So he's great Thanksgiving last week.

616
00:57:47.700 --> 00:57:55.070
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: You you were talking about sort of these these reconnections that you were making and

617
00:57:58.210 --> 00:58:02.939
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: what when, if you continue that making those connections with your family.

618
00:58:03.406 --> 00:58:09.270
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: and and friends, who you might not have connected with as much prior to recovery.

619
00:58:09.680 --> 00:58:15.499
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: are there anything that any activities or anything that you can be involved in that would

620
00:58:15.810 --> 00:58:19.179
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: continue to connect those with those important relationships in your life?

621
00:58:24.270 --> 00:58:30.139
Matthew Warner: No, we they. My family, is trying to get a game night set up on Friday, and wanting us to come

622
00:58:30.240 --> 00:58:39.639
Matthew Warner: on a Friday, and all of us spend time together. We haven't really got got the everything worked out yet, but that's something that we're trying to get going.

623
00:58:40.260 --> 00:58:44.860
Matthew Warner: And hopefully we can get that going soon, actually, because I'm looking forward to it.

624
00:58:46.540 --> 00:58:50.149
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: So what if? What if you took the lead on that?

625
00:58:50.660 --> 00:58:54.120
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: What would that look like? You setting up the game.

626
00:58:54.120 --> 00:58:54.980
Matthew Warner: 9.

627
00:58:56.530 --> 00:58:57.009
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: It sounds good.

628
00:58:57.010 --> 00:58:58.150
Matthew Warner: Probably do that.

629
00:58:59.360 --> 00:59:07.040
Matthew Warner: Yeah, I could probably do that and make it happen before next week. My goal would be get game night going with my family and my woman.

630
00:59:07.650 --> 00:59:08.850
Matthew Warner: That's a good idea.

631
00:59:09.240 --> 00:59:17.139
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: I I just saw your face light up at the mere mention of a game night. We're talking about it. You can. You can see changes in your

632
00:59:17.970 --> 00:59:25.770
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: in your really really nice changes base when you're talking about that and so. And it sounds like

633
00:59:25.990 --> 00:59:29.500
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: you would feel really good if that if that happened.

634
00:59:31.120 --> 00:59:35.740
Matthew Warner: Right. So I'll that's my goal. Then that's what I'll set for myself for next week.

635
00:59:38.130 --> 00:59:41.300
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: Any particular game that you, you all play together.

636
00:59:43.142 --> 00:59:53.780
Matthew Warner: No, we haven't started, so I'm not sure what games they got. I know. I know they got a whole closet full of board games, literally, one closet completely dedicated to board games.

637
00:59:54.040 --> 00:59:57.040
Matthew Warner: So that'll just be random, I guess.

638
00:59:58.990 --> 01:00:04.010
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: Will that that that sounds like a a fun, a fun time! Is there

639
01:00:04.500 --> 01:00:10.269
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: any barriers or anything that might get in the way of you organizing that that you can think of.

640
01:00:12.366 --> 01:00:20.270
Matthew Warner: Not right off that I can think of not really. I mean, they've mentioned it to me a couple of times, so I just need to take initiative and make it happen.

641
01:00:21.860 --> 01:00:23.550
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: Okay. Well, that all that sounds

642
01:00:24.551 --> 01:00:28.156
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: I look. I look forward to hearing how that that goes.

643
01:00:28.980 --> 01:00:30.060
Matthew Warner: Okay. Thank you.

644
01:00:31.250 --> 01:00:33.420
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: All right, Shannon, or Autumn.

645
01:00:37.750 --> 01:00:44.550
Autumn S: Well, I feel like Christian has inspired me. Honestly, because I have.

646
01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:49.070
Autumn S: I'm a big time, Gamer. I like to game. So

647
01:00:49.150 --> 01:00:52.480
Autumn S: a year ago last Christmas I bought the

648
01:00:53.300 --> 01:00:57.710
Autumn S: I forget what it's called, but the thing that goes with switch, and it's like a round

649
01:00:57.770 --> 01:01:04.370
Autumn S: thing that you use to exercise with, and I have not.

650
01:01:04.370 --> 01:01:05.430
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: Oh, Sue thing.

651
01:01:05.950 --> 01:01:06.680
Autumn S: What?

652
01:01:06.680 --> 01:01:08.950
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: Like a Bosu bubble type of a.

653
01:01:08.950 --> 01:01:13.470
Autumn S: Yeah, well, it's something that you use you. You can run with it. You can

654
01:01:13.620 --> 01:01:17.609
Autumn S: do all kinds of games with it. But it's supposed to like you're exercising.

655
01:01:17.670 --> 01:01:20.621
Autumn S: It's it's like tricking your mind, you know.

656
01:01:21.040 --> 01:01:24.960
Autumn S: But I have not opened the box.

657
01:01:25.360 --> 01:01:29.869
Autumn S: That was a year ago, and I feel so bad because

658
01:01:30.070 --> 01:01:35.289
Autumn S: I begged my husband to buy it for me. I was like, Please, please, please, I'll do it, I promise.

659
01:01:36.040 --> 01:01:40.409
Autumn S: And you know he's reminded me a few times.

660
01:01:40.800 --> 01:01:47.490
Autumn S: where's that? Where's that box thing that I got you? Have you? Have you hooked it up yet? And I was like.

661
01:01:47.690 --> 01:01:55.300
Autumn S: no, but I'm going to haven't. But I think I should, because I need to exercise, too, because

662
01:01:55.380 --> 01:01:59.019
Autumn S: when Christian said, like, it hurts to sit like.

663
01:01:59.060 --> 01:02:06.509
Autumn S: okay. So I have a brace on my knee right now, because we like went walking

664
01:02:06.760 --> 01:02:12.749
Autumn S: a little like couple of days ago, and now every time I walk my knee pops.

665
01:02:12.810 --> 01:02:14.870
Autumn S: so I've got a brace on it.

666
01:02:14.970 --> 01:02:17.079
Autumn S: and I know it's because I

667
01:02:18.160 --> 01:02:24.400
Autumn S: I'm very sedentary. So yes, I need to do what Christian said. I need to get up and move.

668
01:02:25.770 --> 01:02:31.019
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: So what's what's prevented you from opening the box for the last year?

669
01:02:31.930 --> 01:02:34.792
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: Is there something about that that scares you?

670
01:02:35.920 --> 01:02:36.670
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: What.

671
01:02:37.470 --> 01:02:42.259
Autumn S: Not. Really. I think that I have really bad Adhd.

672
01:02:42.580 --> 01:02:49.640
Autumn S: so every time I think about doing it I get distracted, and I go do something else.

673
01:02:49.660 --> 01:02:51.299
Autumn S: and then it gets late.

674
01:02:51.800 --> 01:03:01.190
Autumn S: And then I'm like, Oh, I'll do it tomorrow. And I'm yeah and bad about getting distracted.

675
01:03:02.540 --> 01:03:03.360
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: So

676
01:03:03.670 --> 01:03:09.130
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: talk to us about how this works. So you're gonna go and open this box and and try it out.

677
01:03:11.120 --> 01:03:14.349
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: What could get in the way of that actually happening.

678
01:03:15.250 --> 01:03:17.100
Autumn S: Housework.

679
01:03:20.370 --> 01:03:24.770
Autumn S: I you know I just I get distracted. I

680
01:03:25.830 --> 01:03:28.300
Autumn S: I start on one thing, and then

681
01:03:29.240 --> 01:03:32.250
Autumn S: I go through the house and I see something else. Then he's doing

682
01:03:32.310 --> 01:03:37.400
Autumn S: so then I start doing that, and I forget what I was doing to begin with, and

683
01:03:38.360 --> 01:03:41.620
Autumn S: before you know it, it's like the day is gone.

684
01:03:41.660 --> 01:03:45.029
Autumn S: or sometimes I get distracted by my games.

685
01:03:45.170 --> 01:03:48.330
Autumn S: and I will sit and I will game for like hours.

686
01:03:48.530 --> 01:03:52.660
Autumn S: and then I'll realize. Oh, my gosh! I've been sitting here like 4 h.

687
01:03:52.750 --> 01:03:58.979
Autumn S: and then my husband comes home, and of course I'm not going to let him like pick on me while he sees me.

688
01:03:59.110 --> 01:04:02.520
Autumn S: you know. Figure this thing out. I need to do that by myself.

689
01:04:02.710 --> 01:04:05.380
Autumn S: So yeah.

690
01:04:05.740 --> 01:04:14.470
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: Is there something else that needs to happen? First, st before you attempt to open the box.

691
01:04:17.080 --> 01:04:23.430
Autumn S: Maybe, but it can't like for me the perfect scenario would be

692
01:04:23.610 --> 01:04:27.059
Autumn S: if everything around me was perfect if everything was done.

693
01:04:27.150 --> 01:04:39.340
Autumn S: and I couldn't see like any dirty dishes, and I couldn't see any clothes that needed to be washed, or but that can't happen. So I'm just gonna have to like make myself ignore it.

694
01:04:40.400 --> 01:04:46.729
Autumn S: I guess, because I mean nobody's perfect. You can't do everything in one day.

695
01:04:47.260 --> 01:04:51.530
Autumn S: even though I feel like I have to like. I'm supposed to.

696
01:04:52.780 --> 01:04:55.439
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: Are there opportunities where you can

697
01:04:55.730 --> 01:05:00.229
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: remove yourself from that environment to work out? For example.

698
01:05:00.845 --> 01:05:06.980
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: meeting a friend, maybe joining a group. Going someplace where

699
01:05:07.590 --> 01:05:11.450
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: your environment is not part of the issue. You can just focus on you.

700
01:05:12.190 --> 01:05:17.270
Autumn S: I could get my husband to walk with me, but it's really cold outside right now.

701
01:05:19.020 --> 01:05:20.280
Autumn S: But I don't.

702
01:05:21.080 --> 01:05:23.699
Autumn S: I don't really have any friends.

703
01:05:25.490 --> 01:05:26.430
Autumn S: I mean.

704
01:05:27.440 --> 01:05:32.040
Autumn S: I have some friends at church that I say hello to when I see them, but like

705
01:05:32.580 --> 01:05:34.180
Autumn S: I don't have any.

706
01:05:35.940 --> 01:05:39.449
Autumn S: I don't have any friends, because and it's my choice, because

707
01:05:40.173 --> 01:05:47.830
Autumn S: I could have friends, but I just feel like I'm better on my own, and

708
01:05:48.630 --> 01:05:53.469
Autumn S: I don't like to go out of my house very often.

709
01:05:55.280 --> 01:05:57.340
Autumn S: I kind of stay in my house like

710
01:05:58.620 --> 01:06:01.349
Autumn S: all the time, unless my husband says

711
01:06:01.450 --> 01:06:07.130
Autumn S: let's go somewhere, and then I'll go with him. But I don't normally go out alone.

712
01:06:08.360 --> 01:06:14.810
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: So, Ravetra, just put a a question in the in the box. Can your games be your treat for opening your box?

713
01:06:16.530 --> 01:06:24.219
Autumn S: Oh, that's a good idea that that would work. I yeah.

714
01:06:24.260 --> 01:06:25.790
Autumn S: I think I could do that.

715
01:06:27.400 --> 01:06:33.810
Autumn S: Yeah, because then I could play the ones that I wanted to if I played the one that makes me exercise.

716
01:06:34.530 --> 01:06:38.969
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: Do you? Does your church have a a workout group, or anything like that?

717
01:06:40.550 --> 01:06:44.399
Autumn S: No, not not exactly. I mean, we have like a day where

718
01:06:44.520 --> 01:06:47.871
Autumn S: the ladies meet for coffee. We have

719
01:06:49.020 --> 01:06:53.850
Autumn S: like a Bible study where we go and meet, and I know that I could.

720
01:06:53.930 --> 01:06:56.459
Autumn S: I could get one of them to walk with me, but I just

721
01:06:57.970 --> 01:07:00.689
Autumn S: I don't know what it is about me. I just.

722
01:07:01.890 --> 01:07:04.990
Autumn S: I'll go to a church service on a Sunday morning, but

723
01:07:05.910 --> 01:07:10.780
Autumn S: because I feel like I have to put God 1st in my life because I feel like that's important to me.

724
01:07:11.930 --> 01:07:13.560
Autumn S: But I really don't.

725
01:07:14.240 --> 01:07:16.072
Autumn S: I really don't like

726
01:07:17.760 --> 01:07:19.780
Autumn S: It sounds awful the same.

727
01:07:19.970 --> 01:07:22.910
Autumn S: I don't like to socialize with people.

728
01:07:23.280 --> 01:07:27.440
Autumn S: and I don't mean that against any of you guys, because y'all are so nice.

729
01:07:27.670 --> 01:07:31.290
Autumn S: But I just don't. I like the comfort of my home.

730
01:07:32.260 --> 01:07:35.050
Autumn S: It feels like I'm safe here.

731
01:07:36.410 --> 01:07:41.950
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: If there 2 scenarios scenario one is you

732
01:07:42.100 --> 01:07:46.159
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: you open, and I'm just going to say both suit box here, because I'm not sure

733
01:07:46.220 --> 01:07:52.969
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: it sounds like a Bosu, but Scenario one. Is you successfully open the Bosu

734
01:07:52.980 --> 01:07:58.300
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: box in your own home and and start doing that

735
01:07:58.800 --> 01:08:04.120
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: scenario 2 is maybe you take the Bosu to another location.

736
01:08:04.813 --> 01:08:07.230
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: A private location like a

737
01:08:07.300 --> 01:08:09.190
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: a gym or something like that.

738
01:08:09.430 --> 01:08:14.999
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: and and try it there without the distractions that you mentioned at home.

739
01:08:15.350 --> 01:08:22.030
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: Which scenario do you seem more more likely taking the box and going to try it out somewhere else, or taking

740
01:08:22.569 --> 01:08:23.789
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: or doing it at home.

741
01:08:24.120 --> 01:08:25.300
Autumn S: Doing at home.

742
01:08:25.300 --> 01:08:26.719
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: Doing a home, sound.

743
01:08:26.720 --> 01:08:30.330
Autumn S: I have a gym membership. I've had a gym membership for like

744
01:08:30.500 --> 01:08:34.090
Autumn S: a year, and I've been maybe twice.

745
01:08:35.703 --> 01:08:43.672
Autumn S: I see Christian laughing at me. Okay, but I just really

746
01:08:44.910 --> 01:08:47.710
Autumn S: My home is my safe place.

747
01:08:48.080 --> 01:08:49.090
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: It just.

748
01:08:50.660 --> 01:08:53.089
Autumn S: I don't know why and how

749
01:08:53.210 --> 01:08:57.260
Autumn S: that happened, but I feel safer at home.

750
01:08:58.069 --> 01:09:00.789
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: Do you enjoy exercising with your husband.

751
01:09:01.299 --> 01:09:08.379
Autumn S: Do you join? That husband's not gonna exercise? No, he might. He might walk with me.

752
01:09:08.947 --> 01:09:12.429
Autumn S: He's done that before. But as far as like.

753
01:09:12.870 --> 01:09:17.345
Autumn S: yeah, I mean, we both have a gym membership, but we don't go

754
01:09:18.700 --> 01:09:20.300
Autumn S: It's terrible. But.

755
01:09:20.300 --> 01:09:20.850
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: What

756
01:09:22.120 --> 01:09:31.689
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: well, based on your interactions here with this group? I I wouldn't know if you you do a great job socializing here and and interacting with everyone.

757
01:09:33.090 --> 01:09:36.059
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: So between now and next Wednesday.

758
01:09:36.920 --> 01:09:39.820
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: we're going to hear about how the opening of the box went.

759
01:09:40.771 --> 01:09:44.640
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: Where? Where is the box now? Is it like up in the attic with cobwebs or.

760
01:09:44.649 --> 01:09:47.519
Autumn S: No, okay, no, it is.

761
01:09:47.659 --> 01:09:53.499
Autumn S: It is in the drawer of my entertainment center, like, right up under the TV where I was supposed to be doing it.

762
01:09:53.500 --> 01:09:54.260
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: Okay.

763
01:09:54.420 --> 01:09:56.799
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: So next week we're going to hear about

764
01:09:57.510 --> 01:10:00.400
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: everything that happened when you open the box.

765
01:10:00.600 --> 01:10:01.250
Autumn S: Okay.

766
01:10:01.250 --> 01:10:03.379
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: And we'll be excited to hear about that.

767
01:10:04.060 --> 01:10:04.970
Autumn S: Me too.

768
01:10:06.670 --> 01:10:12.683
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: And and hopefully you're as excited about it as you were when you 1st wanted the gift a year ago. So

769
01:10:13.040 --> 01:10:16.379
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: So well, we'll look forward to hearing about that.

770
01:10:16.740 --> 01:10:17.190
Autumn S: Okay.

771
01:10:18.720 --> 01:10:21.229
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: Shannon and and Stacy

772
01:10:25.310 --> 01:10:26.739
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: Stacey, would you like to go.

773
01:10:26.740 --> 01:10:29.859
Stacey Ford: Oh, okay, I was unmuting, am I? Can you hear me?

774
01:10:29.860 --> 01:10:30.879
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: Yes, I can hear you.

775
01:10:30.880 --> 01:10:35.669
Stacey Ford: Okay? Well, I mean, I really don't have.

776
01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:38.960
Stacey Ford: I have a lot of goals. And they're all

777
01:10:39.160 --> 01:10:55.269
Stacey Ford: revolved around myself. Basically, I'm gonna start doing everything for myself and spoiling myself. And I really want to start going back to church. So I guess that would be a goal that that I can do, and my sister goes like 5 times a week. She would love for me to go

778
01:10:55.969 --> 01:10:57.320
Stacey Ford: so I'd really like to.

779
01:10:57.320 --> 01:10:58.629
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: Chicago, or can you do that?

780
01:10:58.630 --> 01:11:05.569
Stacey Ford: Yes, yes, I was born and raised here. So some of my siblings are still here, but mostly around the country.

781
01:11:06.840 --> 01:11:21.530
Stacey Ford: But she would love for me to go. So I think that that will be a goal. I think I'll go do that. But basically I'm I'm really playing catch up on my life and I've got to be here for my brother. He can't walk or anything right now. So I gotta

782
01:11:21.750 --> 01:11:28.670
Stacey Ford: that really basically work on the computer and be near him to be able to help him

783
01:11:29.080 --> 01:11:31.800
Stacey Ford: and get stuff done around his house. And

784
01:11:32.151 --> 01:11:44.910
Stacey Ford: one thing I need to do is is go through my clothes, and it's all Florida clothes, and it's ridiculous. So I think I need to go shopping and get some. Get some warm clothes, because I'm gonna be here a lot longer than I thought.

785
01:11:44.910 --> 01:11:52.550
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: So let's break this down a little bit, and and sort of prioritize what you just said. You mentioned church was option one

786
01:11:52.590 --> 01:11:56.809
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: taking care of your brother was was 2, and then clothes were

787
01:11:57.240 --> 01:12:00.160
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: shopping, for clothes were were 3.

788
01:12:00.160 --> 01:12:03.700
Stacey Ford: Yeah, well, number one would be my brother, for sure. I mean.

789
01:12:03.720 --> 01:12:08.749
Stacey Ford: I yeah, that's necessary. And in the meantime, while I'm doing that

790
01:12:09.348 --> 01:12:15.409
Stacey Ford: I it's not. I can't go anywhere or leave. I mean I'm here for him. So

791
01:12:17.844 --> 01:12:24.585
Stacey Ford: He's actually calling me right now. I'm sorry. And so yeah, cause you probably need something. But

792
01:12:27.010 --> 01:12:36.179
Stacey Ford: yeah. So my brother would be number one and and myself number one. In church. And you know. Just

793
01:12:36.210 --> 01:12:42.589
Stacey Ford: get get caught up on all everything. I've been procrastinating about regarding

794
01:12:42.760 --> 01:12:50.399
Stacey Ford: a lot of jobs I have work catching up to do things like that and just get caught up and get organized.

795
01:12:51.830 --> 01:12:59.069
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: See, when you 1st mentioned church, I instantly thought, and maybe it's because the holidays. But I my thought of home alone, and Kevin

796
01:12:59.712 --> 01:13:03.937
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: going to church? In that in that particular movie

797
01:13:04.650 --> 01:13:07.959
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: cause they're they live in Chicago, I believe, is is where they're at. But.

798
01:13:07.960 --> 01:13:10.130
Stacey Ford: Yeah, I believe it was filmed here. Actually, yeah.

799
01:13:10.406 --> 01:13:14.273
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: So anyway, that was a thought I had as you were talking. But

800
01:13:14.870 --> 01:13:19.500
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: When you, when you think of an important and something between now and next week is

801
01:13:20.810 --> 01:13:23.070
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: is going to to church, and

802
01:13:23.310 --> 01:13:25.409
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: and having that time to yourself. Is that

803
01:13:25.540 --> 01:13:27.299
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: really important to you right now?

804
01:13:28.340 --> 01:13:30.509
Stacey Ford: Yeah, oh, extremely. Yeah.

805
01:13:30.690 --> 01:13:41.879
Stacey Ford: And I mean, I don't have to go to church to have God in my life. I I still have God in my life, but I would like to, maybe cause I'm a lot like autumn. I'm sure I'm exactly like autumn.

806
01:13:42.030 --> 01:13:46.359
Stacey Ford: and having a swimming pool, and I mean, I have a huge screen room

807
01:13:46.480 --> 01:13:53.489
Stacey Ford: and pool, and I do work on a laptop outside or on the beach. You know things like that. So

808
01:13:54.050 --> 01:14:08.837
Stacey Ford: I don't. I mean, it's hard to say that I'm not social, because I'm extremely social, and I've always been in the service, you know, like a bartender and stuff my whole life in the service. Service service. Department. But

809
01:14:09.980 --> 01:14:14.780
Stacey Ford: I have, since my ex. His has

810
01:14:15.070 --> 01:14:17.879
Stacey Ford: tore me down to the point so bad that

811
01:14:18.030 --> 01:14:20.750
Stacey Ford: I I get I got rid of, or

812
01:14:20.790 --> 01:14:33.029
Stacey Ford: you know, deleting my Facebook wasn't allowed to talk to anyone couldn't never, ever one time, not even one time ever went anywhere without him, and and he got me so scared to like

813
01:14:33.110 --> 01:14:37.800
Stacey Ford: to go anywhere that I'm I just stay home, and I'm I'm fine with that. I love it.

814
01:14:38.586 --> 01:14:42.870
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: You mentioned, you have a a close relationship with your sister, is

815
01:14:42.980 --> 01:14:45.299
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: going to church with your sister. Is that.

816
01:14:46.880 --> 01:14:56.809
Stacey Ford: Oh, I think that I would just love that, and she would love that, you know, and and that would make her so happy. And that's why I would go with her.

817
01:14:57.390 --> 01:15:00.659
Stacey Ford: not particularly care for her church as much.

818
01:15:01.087 --> 01:15:03.950
Stacey Ford: But it would be worth it to go.

819
01:15:04.471 --> 01:15:09.430
Stacey Ford: I mean versus going to a different church. I definitely would like to go with her. So.

820
01:15:09.430 --> 01:15:11.020
Christian: Hey! What charge is it?

821
01:15:11.570 --> 01:15:15.109
Stacey Ford: Calvary, Temple in Naperville.

822
01:15:15.260 --> 01:15:16.199
Christian: Oh, okay.

823
01:15:17.928 --> 01:15:26.450
Stacey Ford: It's huge, it it to me it seems more of a business. Not, you know, and I'll it's

824
01:15:26.710 --> 01:15:37.369
Stacey Ford: I I don't know. I saw they spend a lot of time singing, and you know not much of the gospel, and the readings and stuff that I like would like to hear about

825
01:15:38.510 --> 01:15:44.480
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: Do you think you and your sister could go to each other's churches like if you went to hers she could come to yours or.

826
01:15:44.480 --> 01:15:51.080
Stacey Ford: Oh, yeah, I mean, she's she's awesome. She would do anything for me, and absolutely but

827
01:15:51.911 --> 01:15:54.719
Stacey Ford: yeah, she yeah, she would.

828
01:15:56.950 --> 01:16:05.023
Stacey Ford: if she could find the time, I guess, because she's so committed. She she's her. Her schedule is full 7 days a week,

829
01:16:05.510 --> 01:16:08.091
Stacey Ford: And of course helping everybody, too. But

830
01:16:09.180 --> 01:16:17.270
Stacey Ford: yeah. So I think, just, you know, basically focusing on myself getting getting done

831
01:16:17.640 --> 01:16:23.330
Stacey Ford: organized, in which I've already started doing that and getting

832
01:16:23.590 --> 01:16:34.420
Stacey Ford: caught up on everything, and I'm gonna feel so much better. Once I'm done with all that. So in the meantime, helping my brother and getting caught up with my stuff and

833
01:16:35.157 --> 01:16:37.281
Stacey Ford: work jobs and

834
01:16:38.270 --> 01:16:57.140
Stacey Ford: So you know, I have expiration dates and or deadlines, and I'm I'm not doing very good with things right now. I've got too much going on. And in my in my head I don't have. I don't have time to go through my email and then reply, to do do a stuff I can't get. I can't get. Do anything more right now. I can't add any more to my plate, so.

835
01:16:57.370 --> 01:17:01.130
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: Well, next week we'll we'll connect about how

836
01:17:01.560 --> 01:17:04.099
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: your efforts to go to church with. Maybe you can

837
01:17:04.360 --> 01:17:08.681
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: use that as a time to reflect and and take some time for you, and

838
01:17:11.160 --> 01:17:14.680
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: Well, we'll talk. We'll debrief on that next week.

839
01:17:14.860 --> 01:17:27.480
Stacey Ford: That's what everyone's been telling me for years my whole life. Everyone's always told me that, like, you know, stop, you know, focus on yourself. Take care of yourself and everything like that, and I just never have. I've just always

840
01:17:27.840 --> 01:17:35.647
Stacey Ford: I mean I do spoil myself, for sure. You know I love massages, and I love all that stuff, you know. I spoil myself. But

841
01:17:36.040 --> 01:17:51.420
Stacey Ford: For the most part it's like, I just worry too much about everyone else. I'm always helping, and I like to do that. I don't think there's anything wrong with that. But I never focus on myself, and that's wrong. And I that is so hard to do that. I'm starting to do it, and I'm starting to

842
01:17:51.450 --> 01:18:00.059
Stacey Ford: to say No, or you know, say, speak how I really feel versus just saying, yes, okay, sure. No problem, you know. And

843
01:18:00.503 --> 01:18:03.940
Stacey Ford: so I'm I'm starting to stand up for myself, too.

852
01:18:43.090 --> 01:18:48.139

Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: Yes, Anna.

880
01:20:49.690 --> 01:20:56.730
Autumn S: I remember that Shannon was supposed to reconnect with her mother. Did she ever call? Did you call her.

881
01:20:59.060 --> 01:21:03.819
Shannon: Well, I haven't I? I haven't talked to her on the phone recently, even though

882
01:21:04.360 --> 01:21:11.509
Shannon: I actually, I might have for Thanksgiving. I don't remember but I I've talked to her about things, and you know

883
01:21:12.042 --> 01:21:17.477
Shannon: thrown, and I've thrown my my idea out there about possibly trying to stay

884
01:21:18.220 --> 01:21:21.980
Shannon: in Arizona, like, you know, just for a short period of time. And

885
01:21:22.710 --> 01:21:28.220
Shannon: she doesn't really like the idea. So I mean, she's kind of a little bit weird about it, and it's just kinda

886
01:21:28.690 --> 01:21:29.590
Shannon: I don't know.

887
01:21:30.750 --> 01:21:33.849
Autumn S: Okay, it's a if you had had a chance to

888
01:21:33.950 --> 01:21:37.319
Autumn S: talk to her, because I know you said something about that before.

889
01:21:38.180 --> 01:21:42.560
Shannon: Yeah, yeah, I I was gonna bring that up earlier. But I

890
01:21:43.110 --> 01:21:46.629
Shannon: my memory isn't best sometimes. So I just forget.

891
01:21:46.890 --> 01:21:49.989
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: Is she someone that you can connect with about

892
01:21:50.463 --> 01:21:52.660
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: talk, you know, making an appointment, or

893
01:21:52.670 --> 01:21:57.809
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: any of those things? Is she someone you can connect with, to share ideas and.

894
01:21:59.010 --> 01:22:05.680
Shannon: Yeah, somewhat. I mean, she's not very understanding of of any of

895
01:22:06.540 --> 01:22:11.050
Shannon: addiction. Really. She's I mean, she's 70 years old, and she just.

896
01:22:11.580 --> 01:22:15.700
Shannon: She's never really gone through it with my siblings or anything.

897
01:22:15.980 --> 01:22:20.049
Shannon: I'm the youngest and so I don't know she just.

898
01:22:20.220 --> 01:22:23.010
Shannon: She's just a little bit hard to talk to, but

899
01:22:24.300 --> 01:22:27.691
Shannon: I mean I can still talk to her about most anything.

900
01:22:28.680 --> 01:22:32.309
Shannon: she just probably wouldn't really be able to give the best advice.

901
01:22:33.990 --> 01:22:37.579
Shannon: I don't know. I usually have to go somewhere else for that like.

902
01:22:38.610 --> 01:22:39.190
Shannon: Oh.

903
01:22:39.190 --> 01:22:44.300
