169
00:14:59.710 --> 00:15:06.411

Travis Rickford: Yes.

183
00:16:03.840 --> 00:16:09.040
Stacey Ford: Travis, I am so sorry I talk. I talk a lot, but to interrupt.

184
00:16:09.100 --> 00:16:14.960
Stacey Ford: I do, too, as well. Have excuse me, have the the

185
00:16:15.020 --> 00:16:21.780
Stacey Ford: anxiety and all that stuff. And I actually just spoke to my 1st psychiatrist this week.

186
00:16:22.443 --> 00:16:34.130
Stacey Ford: So I did leave a lot of stuff out but I do. I'm not perfect, and I could. There's a lot I could add to all that.

187
00:16:34.586 --> 00:16:39.220
Stacey Ford: So I don't want anyone that has introduced themselves to think that

188
00:16:40.092 --> 00:16:55.939
Stacey Ford: I'm not. I'm any different from than them, and I'm going through a lot with my brother, and he's going through an addition. And so I this is this is, I think, like God calling me, that I need to do so. I I think

189
00:16:55.980 --> 00:17:03.939
Stacey Ford: I don't know. I did not know anything about the group or what it was gonna be about, or HIV and

190
00:17:04.344 --> 00:17:07.170
Stacey Ford: hepatitis, I think, is what I thought it was.

191
00:17:07.200 --> 00:17:16.069
Stacey Ford: And so I'm actually very grateful to now know more more than than I have or did know.

192
00:17:16.079 --> 00:17:16.574
Stacey Ford: Okay,

193
00:17:17.069 --> 00:17:27.319
Stacey Ford: So I did leave a lot out, and I don't. I don't want to feel like that. Look at looking at people differently, or something.

194
00:17:27.469 --> 00:17:35.379
Stacey Ford: You know that I am, too, as well, going through all all symptoms and stuff, you know, regarding

195
00:17:36.139 --> 00:17:37.669
Stacey Ford: mental illness.

196
00:17:37.860 --> 00:17:38.580
Travis Rickford: Okay?

00:17:39.150 --> 00:17:45.137
Travis Rickford: All right. Well, well, thanks for adding that Stacy. And and today we're really going to

199
00:17:55.026 --> 00:17:58.530
Travis Rickford: work on over the next 3 weeks. And and

200
00:17:58.650 --> 00:18:08.299
Travis Rickford: this group or this group session, specifically, we'll focus on relationships and what that looks like

201
00:18:08.380 --> 00:18:15.030
Travis Rickford: for for you specifically, what that support look, that support network looks like for you.

Travis Rickford: And specifically

203
00:18:17.410 --> 00:18:23.249
Travis Rickford: some things that you want to work on over the next week with support from the group. So we'll do some individual work

204
00:18:23.834 --> 00:18:29.509
Travis Rickford: with with all of you. But we'll also do that with the support of the group.

205
00:18:31.790 --> 00:18:43.850
Travis Rickford: So we're gonna start that conversation right now and then, and before we do that, though, just wanna highlight a couple of housekeeping things, one keep your screen on at all times. I always enjoy

206
00:18:43.970 --> 00:18:48.160
Travis Rickford: looking at a face. It makes it makes things a lot easier.

207
00:18:48.540 --> 00:18:53.290
Travis Rickford: 2, when you're when you're not talking, feel free to to put yourself on on mute

208
00:18:54.018 --> 00:18:56.661
Travis Rickford: there will be times where?

209
00:18:57.280 --> 00:19:01.440
Travis Rickford: I interrupt you, and if I interrupt you, it's not to be rude. It's just that we have

210
00:19:01.580 --> 00:19:12.040
Travis Rickford: a lot of people in the space. And I wanna make sure that we get to everyone. So just know that's not being me rude. That's just me. Wanting to make sure we keep the conversation moving.

211
00:19:12.530 --> 00:19:16.727
Travis Rickford: And then finally, this is an open space. So in this space

212
00:19:17.380 --> 00:19:22.680
Travis Rickford: we we call we. We go from 0 to 100 pretty quickly, and where we get to

213
00:19:22.710 --> 00:19:30.500
Travis Rickford: we get to talk about some issues that are important to us. But also how the the group can support that

214
00:19:31.720 --> 00:19:34.800
Travis Rickford: any any questions before we, before we get started.

215
00:19:36.320 --> 00:19:37.080
Michael Whale: No.

216
00:19:41.920 --> 00:19:42.580
Kenneth Matthew Warner: Nice.

217
00:19:43.140 --> 00:19:43.800
Travis Rickford: Did you have a question.

218
00:19:43.800 --> 00:19:53.850
Stacey Ford: Can I vape I I'm so sorry. Yes, can I vape like vapor my cigarette vape?

219
00:19:55.260 --> 00:19:56.100
Stacey Ford: No.

220
00:19:56.660 --> 00:20:00.629
Travis Rickford: It. It would be good if you, if you need to do that.

221
00:20:01.580 --> 00:20:04.290
Stacey Ford: To to leave. And then, okay.

222
00:20:07.060 --> 00:20:10.399
Stacey Ford: okay, no, no. Okay. I understand.

223
00:20:10.930 --> 00:20:12.049
Travis Rickford: Alright. Thank you.

224
00:20:12.200 --> 00:20:15.153
Travis Rickford: So with that I would

225
00:20:16.560 --> 00:20:18.730
Kenneth Matthew Warner: Invite the group to think about.

226
00:20:19.650 --> 00:20:26.250
Travis Rickford: Your your current relationships. In your life, and and what that that looks like, and

227
00:20:27.350 --> 00:20:30.698
Travis Rickford: all of us here are are here to support

228
00:20:31.770 --> 00:20:37.539
Travis Rickford: support each other's health, but also relationship with others. And and as we look at

229
00:20:37.750 --> 00:20:43.619
Travis Rickford: different goals that we want to make for ourselves, and that really starts with relationships. And

230
00:20:43.820 --> 00:20:47.700
Travis Rickford: and my 1st question is to you, is.

231
00:20:47.850 --> 00:20:52.710
Travis Rickford: are there any lost, currently any lost relationships in your life?

232
00:20:54.150 --> 00:21:01.110
Travis Rickford: Or are there others that you would like to support in their efforts to

233
00:21:01.629 --> 00:21:08.620
Travis Rickford: address some of the health concerns in their life. So would just like to open up the conversation there.

234
00:21:08.880 --> 00:21:10.600
Travis Rickford: and and we'll start with that.

235
00:21:12.832 --> 00:21:22.779
Stacey Ford: I do. I do excuse me. I am 52. I had my daughter when I was 17, and

236
00:21:24.835 --> 00:21:29.880
Stacey Ford: and I have 3 grandchildren older and

237
00:21:30.793 --> 00:21:35.680
Stacey Ford: she is at this point, not speaking to me

238
00:21:36.270 --> 00:21:49.689
Stacey Ford: pretty much because of the terrible relationship that I was in for the 10 years and that's something that I need to. I'm doing everything I can basically to

239
00:21:50.910 --> 00:21:52.160
Stacey Ford: build that.

240
00:21:52.390 --> 00:21:56.140
Stacey Ford: And I and hopefully, I'm getting really close.

241
00:21:57.600 --> 00:22:03.190
Travis Rickford: And can you? Can you tell us more about this relationship? And and you said that was with your daughter Stacy.

242
00:22:04.640 --> 00:22:09.080
Stacey Ford: Yes, excuse me. Yeah, my daughter. Mallor. Yes.

243
00:22:10.790 --> 00:22:14.353
Travis Rickford: And so tell us more about what happened.

244
00:22:15.498 --> 00:22:19.871
Stacey Ford: I feel I she she

245
00:22:21.610 --> 00:22:32.199
Stacey Ford: She just quit talking to me just cut all contact with me, and I believe there's a lot more to it.

246
00:22:32.240 --> 00:22:33.000
Stacey Ford: But

247
00:22:34.110 --> 00:22:40.219
Stacey Ford: With her husband, who had her brainwashed, who she has since I know, got divorced.

248
00:22:40.250 --> 00:22:43.040
Stacey Ford: They they're no longer together.

249
00:22:44.710 --> 00:22:53.879
Stacey Ford: I have 3 grandbaby grandsons that live pretty close to me in Illinois right now that I'm trying to get to

250
00:22:55.440 --> 00:22:57.540
Stacey Ford: a resolution of

251
00:22:57.700 --> 00:23:05.890
Stacey Ford: of talking to her, and I believe that she is willing to do that at this point right now. So

252
00:23:07.986 --> 00:23:12.500
Stacey Ford: my ex that

253
00:23:13.440 --> 00:23:21.750
Stacey Ford: you know, than I am right now since June, July, since I've been in Illinois,

254
00:23:23.640 --> 00:23:27.289
Stacey Ford: at my brother's house, and alone.

255
00:23:30.030 --> 00:23:32.119
Stacey Ford: I'm I'm not with Eric.

256
00:23:32.130 --> 00:23:48.410
Stacey Ford: and my daughter doesn't know that, and he is the. I think. I believe. I believe that he is the reason why she quit talking to me. She feels he's a devil. She hates him for everything he's done to me, and it's been horrible, and she feels that I chose him

257
00:23:48.470 --> 00:23:51.949
Stacey Ford: over her. I believe that's what she feels.

258
00:23:53.070 --> 00:23:53.980
Stacey Ford: So

259
00:23:55.970 --> 00:24:07.660
Stacey Ford: so yeah, I'm going. I'm I'm going with going through that and life is short, and I mean family is everything, and

260
00:24:07.840 --> 00:24:10.919
Stacey Ford: and that's my number one goal. But I'm

261
00:24:10.980 --> 00:24:26.639
Stacey Ford: have my mom's heart, and I do everything I can for everyone except myself pretty much. And so right now I'm just maybe that's my number. One goal is to have her and my grandchildren in my life.

262
00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:30.570
Stacey Ford: and that that's my number one goal.

263
00:24:31.730 --> 00:24:36.310
Travis Rickford: So, Stacey, what do you think is the 1st step in

264
00:24:36.790 --> 00:24:39.590
Travis Rickford: rebuilding that relationship? What are some

265
00:24:40.320 --> 00:24:43.610
Travis Rickford: things that you might consider to start doing that.

266
00:24:45.847 --> 00:24:53.050
Stacey Ford: I'm just currently leaving my ex and just since June

267
00:24:53.160 --> 00:25:03.374
Stacey Ford: since I come since I left Florida, and am in Illinois right now, but kind of living in both, because I'm moving back and

268
00:25:04.080 --> 00:25:18.950
Stacey Ford: I need to. It's been a disaster for a few months when I was here. That I don't want to get into, and it basically with my boyfriend, or I'm sorry not my boyfriend, my brother, his girlfriend

269
00:25:19.401 --> 00:25:30.928
Stacey Ford: who has been terrorizing them. And right and right now he's in the er or I'm not in the er I took him to the er he's in the hospital, he's admitted he had admitted. Wednesday. And

270
00:25:31.450 --> 00:25:43.900
Stacey Ford: That's what's important to me, and he does. He does like do cocaine and stuff like that where he he's a perfect father, but I'm trying to help him get healthy.

271
00:25:43.900 --> 00:26:04.019
Stacey Ford: He they won't release him. He can't walk. He might have meningitis. He's got congestive heart failure. They can't figure out what's wrong with him, and so I need to get to the hospital, too, as well. But it's a big head scratcher, and it could have something to do. Excuse me with meningitis.

272
00:26:04.989 --> 00:26:11.909
Stacey Ford: It's they can't figure out what it is. They he can't sit still in it.

273
00:26:12.020 --> 00:26:13.789
Stacey Ford: I and his

274
00:26:13.810 --> 00:26:27.078
Stacey Ford: lumbars there he has a spinal tap. So the fur or the 4 4 spinal tap, whatever spinal like number 19, 8, 7, or whatever

275
00:26:27.690 --> 00:26:34.230
Stacey Ford: basically are bad, and they're degenerative, and he can't walk. So they.

276
00:26:34.795 --> 00:26:39.670
Travis Rickford: Wanna, I wanna interrupt you here. When it when it relates to

277
00:26:39.700 --> 00:26:42.549
Travis Rickford: the going back to the relationship with your daughter.

278
00:26:43.040 --> 00:26:46.566
Travis Rickford: What if if that relationship were to

279
00:26:48.770 --> 00:26:52.149
Travis Rickford: move in the right direction for both of you, what would that do for you?

280
00:26:52.300 --> 00:26:54.070
Travis Rickford: How would how would that help you.

281
00:26:54.070 --> 00:26:57.260
Stacey Ford: That would make my my life complete.

282
00:26:58.740 --> 00:27:01.589
Travis Rickford: And and how so? How would that make your life more complete?

283
00:27:02.900 --> 00:27:16.140
Stacey Ford: Because she's the most important thing to me, and to have her and have my grandkids back in my life. I I lived with them in Florida for a couple of years prior to this.

284
00:27:16.815 --> 00:27:22.909
Stacey Ford: And it it they were much younger at that point, and

285
00:27:25.190 --> 00:27:43.440
Stacey Ford: and for them to be just taken taken from me, and I have never seen or talked to them. Send presents and gifts and Amazon cards, Christmas and birthday present everything, and no communication at all. So I

286
00:27:43.870 --> 00:27:44.780
Stacey Ford: that's

287
00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:51.140
Stacey Ford: That would be the best thing that could happen to me.

288
00:27:51.140 --> 00:27:59.310
Travis Rickford: So opening up, opening this up to the rest of the group after hearing Stacy's story, have you

289
00:27:59.770 --> 00:28:01.226
Travis Rickford: have you ever become

290
00:28:02.620 --> 00:28:08.429
Travis Rickford: estranged or or lost someone in your life. And what were those initial steps that you took.

291
00:28:09.310 --> 00:28:10.100
Stacey Ford: There you go!

292
00:28:10.100 --> 00:28:14.260
Travis Rickford: That relationship. And this is for the whole group. Do you have any strategy?

293
00:28:14.260 --> 00:28:15.460
Travis Rickford: Well, I've tried.

294
00:28:15.820 --> 00:28:24.740
Stacey Ford: Well, I have a lot to talk about, I mean, in 2,012. My mother had a fatal accident and died.

295
00:28:24.740 --> 00:28:25.180
Travis Rickford: Yeah.

296
00:28:25.390 --> 00:28:40.169
Stacey Ford: I have 11 siblings. And the day that my mom we took off life support. My dad almost died, and he was diagnosed with stage 4 cancer, and I stayed with him until he died.

297
00:28:40.538 --> 00:28:47.450
Stacey Ford: And at the same time my sister went missing out of Key West, Florida. So she's still missing. That was 2,016.

298
00:28:47.968 --> 00:28:50.900
Stacey Ford: My nephew graduated college, went to China

299
00:28:51.950 --> 00:28:55.849
Stacey Ford: and mysteriously died there. So yeah, I have all these stories.

300
00:28:56.390 --> 00:28:59.664
Travis Rickford: Yeah, but but for now

301
00:29:00.400 --> 00:29:06.619
Travis Rickford: that is. And when you think of those stories as the relationship with your daughter is that the one that's most important to you right now.

302
00:29:06.820 --> 00:29:08.060
Stacey Ford: Absolutely.

303
00:29:08.060 --> 00:29:09.777
Travis Rickford: Okay? And so

304
00:29:10.540 --> 00:29:18.020
Travis Rickford: what? I, what I want to bring the whole group in for the conversation before is for those for those for others in the group.

305
00:29:18.180 --> 00:29:21.250
Travis Rickford: What are some things that you've tried? If you've

306
00:29:22.260 --> 00:29:29.860
Travis Rickford: become estranged or lost a relationship, what are some strategies that you've tried to begin to to rebuild those.

307
00:29:32.680 --> 00:29:33.770
Travis Rickford: and this can be anything.

308
00:29:34.250 --> 00:29:36.460
Michael Whale: Trying to talk. I guess. Yeah.

309
00:29:36.460 --> 00:29:39.269
Autumn McLaughlin: Youngest daughter and my son.

310
00:29:39.679 --> 00:29:43.310
Autumn McLaughlin: My oldest daughter is the only one that has anything to do with me.

311
00:29:44.750 --> 00:29:52.460
Autumn McLaughlin: And it's because of a mistake that I made a long, long time ago, like maybe 10 years ago.

312
00:29:53.850 --> 00:29:55.399
Autumn McLaughlin: And I have. I have.

313
00:29:56.140 --> 00:30:03.789
Autumn McLaughlin: I have tried to talk to her because my son is only ignoring me because

314
00:30:04.010 --> 00:30:06.850
Autumn McLaughlin: of his sister, so he's just kind of like

315
00:30:07.140 --> 00:30:09.370
Autumn McLaughlin: jumped on the bandwagon. I guess

316
00:30:09.510 --> 00:30:11.729
Autumn McLaughlin: you know he's supporting her, but

317
00:30:12.520 --> 00:30:15.870
Autumn McLaughlin: she's told a lot of lies. There is some truth.

318
00:30:15.980 --> 00:30:19.250
Autumn McLaughlin: Then she sold lies, and I the truth.

319
00:30:19.460 --> 00:30:22.530
Autumn McLaughlin: I admitted, and I tried to talk to her.

320
00:30:23.250 --> 00:30:25.810
Autumn McLaughlin: I've apologized numerous times.

321
00:30:26.545 --> 00:30:30.590
Autumn McLaughlin: So is my husband. We've tried to

322
00:30:31.030 --> 00:30:36.829
Autumn McLaughlin: meet her on her level wherever she wanted us to meet her and talk to her.

323
00:30:37.010 --> 00:30:45.810
Autumn McLaughlin: and she's refused. And I've sent her gifts. She's actually living with my mom. She's not even, but

324
00:30:46.170 --> 00:30:54.940
Autumn McLaughlin: maybe 15 min away from me. But she before that we were really close and she's getting married.

325
00:30:57.100 --> 00:31:00.720
Autumn McLaughlin: and I really love the guy that she's marrying, because

326
00:31:01.080 --> 00:31:06.899
Autumn McLaughlin: just a few months ago we were all very close, and but she won't let me

327
00:31:07.140 --> 00:31:09.899
Autumn McLaughlin: have anything to do with her, so

328
00:31:10.110 --> 00:31:13.659
Autumn McLaughlin: she's told me that we're not invited to the wedding, and

329
00:31:14.650 --> 00:31:17.050
Autumn McLaughlin: it just really hurts a lot. So.

330
00:31:17.630 --> 00:31:23.940
Autumn McLaughlin: But I've tried everything that I can think of. I've I've I've sent her gifts. I've

331
00:31:25.060 --> 00:31:29.499
Autumn McLaughlin: but I'm I'm not talking to anyone over at my mom's house at this point, because

332
00:31:29.510 --> 00:31:32.620
Autumn McLaughlin: I feel betrayed because they're all helping her

333
00:31:32.840 --> 00:31:36.870
Autumn McLaughlin: get ready for her special day, but not telling her.

334
00:31:38.230 --> 00:31:41.089
Autumn McLaughlin: you know. Why don't you talk to your mother? Why don't you

335
00:31:41.390 --> 00:31:44.019
Autumn McLaughlin: let your dad walk you down the aisle? Why.

336
00:31:44.800 --> 00:31:47.070
Travis Rickford: And and this is your oldest daughter, Autumn.

337
00:31:47.070 --> 00:31:48.220
Autumn McLaughlin: It's my youngest.

338
00:31:48.220 --> 00:31:49.310
Travis Rickford: Youngest daughter.

339
00:31:49.750 --> 00:31:52.109
Travis Rickford: And what was the?

340
00:31:53.040 --> 00:31:56.600
Travis Rickford: What happened? Was there a moment where that relationship changed?

341
00:31:57.060 --> 00:31:57.830
Autumn McLaughlin: Yeah,

342
00:31:59.990 --> 00:32:04.399
Autumn McLaughlin: 10 years ago. My husband and I were.

343
00:32:05.470 --> 00:32:08.170
Autumn McLaughlin: We met up with some people that were.

344
00:32:09.940 --> 00:32:13.630
Autumn McLaughlin: They just weren't really good people for us to be around.

345
00:32:13.760 --> 00:32:17.159
Autumn McLaughlin: and we ended up in a lifestyle that we

346
00:32:17.240 --> 00:32:21.470
Autumn McLaughlin: didn't need to be in. It was a Swingers group, and

347
00:32:22.240 --> 00:32:27.510
Autumn McLaughlin: and because of because we brought someone in to our home.

348
00:32:27.950 --> 00:32:29.130
Autumn McLaughlin: He

349
00:32:32.910 --> 00:32:33.540
Autumn McLaughlin: hey?

350
00:32:34.690 --> 00:32:36.259
Autumn McLaughlin: It's hard, I mean.

351
00:32:39.760 --> 00:32:47.359
Autumn McLaughlin: He approached her. And he, you know, and it's just.

352
00:32:48.500 --> 00:32:53.519
Autumn McLaughlin: and I would have done anything in the world to protect my children, but I didn't, because

353
00:32:55.800 --> 00:32:58.170
Autumn McLaughlin: I let these people influence me and I.

354
00:32:59.450 --> 00:33:12.299
Autumn McLaughlin: So I apologized, and I tried really hard, but since then she's like started making up other lies like that we left them, and that we abandoned them when we never did. And my oldest daughter is.

355
00:33:12.590 --> 00:33:17.629
Autumn McLaughlin: you know she she talks to my youngest daughter.

356
00:33:17.770 --> 00:33:23.140
Autumn McLaughlin: and you know, because she's trying to have a relationship with her. But it's like

357
00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:28.130
Autumn McLaughlin: she knows that my youngest daughter is lying about a lot.

358
00:33:28.300 --> 00:33:33.190
Autumn McLaughlin: and she told my mother when she was here from Florida, she said, you know

359
00:33:33.210 --> 00:33:36.470
Autumn McLaughlin: she's lying about a lot of it. And my mom was like.

360
00:33:36.550 --> 00:33:41.799
Autumn McLaughlin: Yeah, I know. But you know I have to support her. Well, what about me?

361
00:33:41.830 --> 00:33:44.870
Autumn McLaughlin: You know she's just everyone is

362
00:33:45.140 --> 00:33:49.070
Autumn McLaughlin: even his parents, the the man that she's marrying.

363
00:33:49.300 --> 00:33:55.280
Autumn McLaughlin: They think that we're deadbeat parents because they're believing everything she says.

364
00:33:55.580 --> 00:33:57.650
Autumn McLaughlin: And there was just one mistake.

365
00:33:57.940 --> 00:34:00.790
Autumn McLaughlin: and I apologize, and I know it was a huge one.

366
00:34:01.510 --> 00:34:04.620
Autumn McLaughlin: But I've I don't know what to do.

367
00:34:04.980 --> 00:34:08.099
Travis Rickford: So what's the what's your relationship with your

368
00:34:09.040 --> 00:34:13.790
Travis Rickford: When when you think of people right now in your space that are close to you and provide support.

369
00:34:14.440 --> 00:34:15.440
Travis Rickford: does your?

370
00:34:15.690 --> 00:34:18.630
Travis Rickford: How? What's the relationship look like between you and your husband?

371
00:34:19.260 --> 00:34:24.119
Autumn McLaughlin: He. He's the the most supportive person in the world.

372
00:34:25.460 --> 00:34:27.160
Autumn McLaughlin: You know. He tells me.

373
00:34:27.620 --> 00:34:30.279
Autumn McLaughlin: you know. Just give it to God. And don't

374
00:34:31.150 --> 00:34:34.379
Autumn McLaughlin: you know, I get really stressed. And sometimes I can't like

375
00:34:35.570 --> 00:34:39.610
Autumn McLaughlin: it's like, I just don't want to be, because.

376
00:34:41.080 --> 00:34:44.849
Autumn McLaughlin: you know, I always wanted to be a good mom, and I feel like I failed.

377
00:34:48.870 --> 00:34:49.630
Travis Rickford: So

378
00:34:50.550 --> 00:34:57.479
Travis Rickford: what are some? So you you said you've tried to reach out to her and and and she's just ignoring you.

379
00:34:57.480 --> 00:34:58.989
Travis Rickford: Yeah, she won't.

380
00:34:59.130 --> 00:35:05.800
Autumn McLaughlin: She won't have anything to do with me. She told me to stay out of her life, and

381
00:35:06.050 --> 00:35:09.919
Autumn McLaughlin: you know the weirdest thing is that we were super close, and then

382
00:35:10.610 --> 00:35:18.469
Autumn McLaughlin: my oldest daughter lives in Florida. So we both went to Florida at the same time, because we have a grandson, and we went for his second birthday.

383
00:35:18.580 --> 00:35:20.460
Autumn McLaughlin: and while we were there

384
00:35:20.920 --> 00:35:30.039
Autumn McLaughlin: I said one thing to my youngest daughter, and at the time we were close, and I said, you know you don't have to be so rude, because she's very blunt about.

385
00:35:30.280 --> 00:35:32.210
Autumn McLaughlin: She's just that type of person.

386
00:35:32.340 --> 00:35:37.390
Autumn McLaughlin: and she said something to me, and I thought it was really rude, and I said, You don't have to be rude to me.

387
00:35:38.210 --> 00:35:43.230
Autumn McLaughlin: and it made her mad. And then she brought this whole thing up from 10 years ago.

388
00:35:43.530 --> 00:35:45.990
Autumn McLaughlin: And my thing is, there is

389
00:35:46.070 --> 00:35:49.699
Autumn McLaughlin: any moment that she could have come to me

390
00:35:49.910 --> 00:35:52.819
Autumn McLaughlin: and said, Mom, I need to talk to you about this.

391
00:35:53.260 --> 00:35:59.449
Autumn McLaughlin: But she waited until we were in Florida to just explode and tell everyone there.

392
00:36:00.160 --> 00:36:06.389
Autumn McLaughlin: and it was like she was just lashing out at me, and then, since then she's just cut me off completely.

393
00:36:08.640 --> 00:36:09.160
Travis Rickford: And

394
00:36:09.420 --> 00:36:15.919
Travis Rickford: and again opening this up to the the whole group for those of you that have been in in similar situations, where you've

395
00:36:16.660 --> 00:36:20.339
Travis Rickford: lost a really important relationship, and

396
00:36:20.390 --> 00:36:22.289
Travis Rickford: may have regained it later. But

397
00:36:22.860 --> 00:36:30.200
Travis Rickford: what were some initial steps that you took to start rebuilding those bridges that you had lost.

398
00:36:34.400 --> 00:36:36.849
Travis Rickford: and anyone could answer Michael.

399
00:36:36.850 --> 00:36:41.710
Michael Whale: I guess. Stop like, you know, using and drinking and lying.

400
00:36:41.720 --> 00:36:47.640
Michael Whale: That's the thing like just did. I guess the basic things.

401
00:36:49.580 --> 00:36:52.149
Travis Rickford: So the the 1st step you took was

402
00:36:52.200 --> 00:36:54.849
Travis Rickford: just stopping those things that you mentioned was that.

403
00:36:55.750 --> 00:37:01.640
Michael Whale: Well, yeah, I mean, it's usually said they're done, but it has to get done. Otherwise. I'm just gonna lose everyone. So.

404
00:37:03.530 --> 00:37:13.440
Travis Rickford: So autumn. Is there? Anything that's happening right now? That's still getting in the way of that relationship.

405
00:37:14.310 --> 00:37:17.010
Kenneth Matthew Warner: No, nothing. I've.

406
00:37:17.020 --> 00:37:22.500
Autumn McLaughlin: Completely changed my life. I you know, and

407
00:37:24.450 --> 00:37:27.699
Autumn McLaughlin: but she's just she's holding the past over my head.

408
00:37:29.520 --> 00:37:34.970
Travis Rickford: So I use this. I'll call it a metaphor, but or an example

409
00:37:35.100 --> 00:37:41.039
Travis Rickford: for those of you that have ever been on an airplane. The flight attendant always gives the

410
00:37:43.290 --> 00:37:52.989
Travis Rickford: tells us what we need to do in case of an emergency, and and one of those things is, I always thought it was strange, you know, to to put on the mask. Put the mask on yourself.

411
00:37:53.160 --> 00:37:53.569
Stacey Ford: Yeah, but.

412
00:37:53.570 --> 00:38:01.188
Travis Rickford: And then and then help others. And and that's that's 1 question for for you. Autumn

413
00:38:02.350 --> 00:38:13.339
Travis Rickford: What needs to happen before you, with with you before you even begin to rebuild that relationship. Is there? Is there some healing that needs to take place with you before

414
00:38:13.420 --> 00:38:15.050
Travis Rickford: you? You start working.

415
00:38:16.020 --> 00:38:25.230
Autumn McLaughlin: Oh, great, yeah, I mean, I've got a new doctor and I'm actually she's actually

416
00:38:27.560 --> 00:38:30.251
Autumn McLaughlin: she's trying to diagnose me.

417
00:38:31.430 --> 00:38:35.390
Autumn McLaughlin: I said I had depression. But the the truth is, she's

418
00:38:36.070 --> 00:38:42.700
Autumn McLaughlin: she's between depression and bipolar, and she's not sure which I so

419
00:38:43.390 --> 00:38:48.799
Autumn McLaughlin: she told me to get a therapist about 3 weeks ago, and I haven't gotten one yet.

420
00:38:49.380 --> 00:38:50.580
Autumn McLaughlin: and it probably should.

421
00:38:53.710 --> 00:38:56.309
Travis Rickford: So it is that something that

422
00:38:57.350 --> 00:39:03.750
Travis Rickford: you could could do between now and our next meeting that we have is to find someone. Would that.

423
00:39:04.640 --> 00:39:05.420
Autumn McLaughlin: I can.

424
00:39:05.420 --> 00:39:09.590
Travis Rickford: Would that be a initial 1st step, or is there something else that you need to do before that.

425
00:39:09.950 --> 00:39:13.759
Stacey Ford: Hey? Autumn! What what state do you live in.

426
00:39:13.760 --> 00:39:15.120
Autumn McLaughlin: North Carolina.

427
00:39:16.450 --> 00:39:32.589
Stacey Ford: I might be able to find you a place, I and then, you know, get the message to send it put on the the app we have, or something, you know. I'll look into it. I might be able to find you a place for free, for free.

428
00:39:32.590 --> 00:39:38.210
Autumn McLaughlin: I've got a list that my! I don't know exactly what she does.

429
00:39:38.340 --> 00:39:45.560
Autumn McLaughlin: I mean. She's like the head of the mental health place where I'm going, she says, like she.

430
00:39:46.540 --> 00:39:51.150
Autumn McLaughlin: I asked her if she could be my therapist, because I really like talking to her, but she said that

431
00:39:51.190 --> 00:39:54.420
Autumn McLaughlin: she couldn't, because she does the diagnosis.

432
00:39:54.540 --> 00:39:56.650
Stacey Ford: Oh, that's okay.

433
00:39:56.650 --> 00:40:02.159
Autumn McLaughlin: She gave me a sheet of like people that I need to check into, but I just.

434
00:40:02.160 --> 00:40:03.649
Stacey Ford: That's great! That's great!

435
00:40:03.650 --> 00:40:04.060
Autumn McLaughlin: Do it.

436
00:40:05.050 --> 00:40:05.920
Stacey Ford: Well, if he

437
00:40:06.350 --> 00:40:13.559
Stacey Ford: any questions or any help, I I am very resourceful, so I'll let you know if you have any questions.

438
00:40:14.030 --> 00:40:15.190
Autumn McLaughlin: Thank you.

439
00:40:15.190 --> 00:40:21.339
Travis Rickford: And and, Stacey, you brought up a a good point, so all of you have access to Grove.

440
00:40:21.360 --> 00:40:29.660
Travis Rickford: In addition to the time that we meet here you have access to Grove, and you can communicate with each other. Through that mechanism as well.

441
00:40:29.660 --> 00:40:30.610
Stacey Ford: Thank you.

442
00:40:31.230 --> 00:40:35.600
Travis Rickford: But autumn you between now and

443
00:40:35.920 --> 00:40:39.250
Travis Rickford: and let's just say next week. Do you think it would be

444
00:40:41.830 --> 00:40:43.450
Travis Rickford: Do you think you'd be able to

445
00:40:43.500 --> 00:40:47.170
Travis Rickford: contact and and set up an initial appointment with the therapist to start.

446
00:40:48.120 --> 00:40:50.630
Autumn McLaughlin: I can. I have the names I just

447
00:40:51.370 --> 00:40:55.469
Autumn McLaughlin: I don't know why I mean well, it may be part of the Adhd. I just

448
00:40:56.710 --> 00:40:58.879
Autumn McLaughlin: put things away sometimes, and I don't

449
00:40:58.890 --> 00:41:02.840
Autumn McLaughlin: do them in a timely manner, but I will.

450
00:41:04.670 --> 00:41:08.970
Travis Rickford: So for the rest of you, after hearing from from Stacey and autumn.

451
00:41:09.612 --> 00:41:18.330
Travis Rickford: What is something really important to you right now in terms of of making progress on

452
00:41:19.160 --> 00:41:22.860
Travis Rickford: a lost relationship. Or maybe it's being a support for others.

453
00:41:22.970 --> 00:41:24.519
Travis Rickford: What does that look like for you

454
00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:26.370
Travis Rickford: who would like to go next.

455
00:41:34.170 --> 00:41:35.660
Christian: Hi, this is Christian.

456
00:41:38.710 --> 00:41:41.030
Christian: I had been married for 30 years.

457
00:41:41.710 --> 00:41:48.869
Christian: It was rocky at best. It was kind of a shotgun wedding thing.

458
00:41:49.470 --> 00:41:54.090
Christian: and but we may. You know we had our great times. We had not so great times.

459
00:41:54.830 --> 00:42:01.590
Christian: and I drink, and she didn't like that, and I didn't care.

460
00:42:02.970 --> 00:42:12.380
Christian: So ultimately I started going to counseling, and a A and got myself

461
00:42:13.010 --> 00:42:17.989
Christian: pretty well straight, but then, I mean, she didn't want to participate in any of that.

462
00:42:18.790 --> 00:42:21.150
Christian: and you know we had a

463
00:42:21.180 --> 00:42:24.890
Christian: quote unquote surprise intervention for her

464
00:42:25.040 --> 00:42:28.449
Christian: with our circle of friends who

465
00:42:28.460 --> 00:42:33.239
Christian: we've known, you know I've known for 50 years, and she flocked out.

466
00:42:34.130 --> 00:42:40.120
Christian: So at that stage of the game, you know, I had to make a decision on.

467
00:42:41.160 --> 00:42:44.359
Christian: Was this worth saving or not.

468
00:42:45.090 --> 00:42:51.519
Christian: and unfortunately I had. It was a very tough decision to make, but I made the decision to say.

469
00:42:52.140 --> 00:42:53.930
Christian: You know we're not compatible.

470
00:42:56.780 --> 00:42:59.420
Christian: But there was a lot of, you know self.

471
00:43:00.450 --> 00:43:01.110
Kenneth Matthew Warner: Awesome.

472
00:43:01.460 --> 00:43:02.570
Christian: God.

473
00:43:02.880 --> 00:43:09.700
Christian: I had to dig deep within myself to make sure that I understood, and that my rationale, and that my motives

474
00:43:09.780 --> 00:43:23.559
Christian: and motivations were based on sound, and, you know sound facts as opposed to emotions and being selfish.

475
00:43:24.420 --> 00:43:27.289
Christian: and it took number of years.

476
00:43:28.880 --> 00:43:32.150
Travis Rickford: And so are you. And are you and your wife currently together?

477
00:43:33.297 --> 00:43:36.400
Christian: No, we've been divorced now for 10 years.

478
00:43:36.400 --> 00:43:37.190
Travis Rickford: Oh, okay.

479
00:43:38.173 --> 00:43:41.446
Christian: We have 2 boys, though, that are adults. And

480
00:43:43.620 --> 00:43:49.549
Christian: I may, you know I have no problems with her now that we have distance between us.

481
00:43:50.070 --> 00:43:53.449
Christian: and I don't really interface with her that much.

482
00:43:54.090 --> 00:43:56.720
Christian: but it's not like, you know.

483
00:43:56.990 --> 00:44:00.560
Christian: She's gonna burn my house down, or I'm gonna go burn hers down.

484
00:44:01.260 --> 00:44:03.379
Christian: It's a reasonable relationship.

485
00:44:04.100 --> 00:44:07.369
Travis Rickford: What's the relationship like with your your 2 boys?

486
00:44:08.800 --> 00:44:09.870
Christian: They

487
00:44:13.920 --> 00:44:19.139
Christian: They're concerned about my drinking in the respect of my health.

488
00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:23.139
Christian: But as far as the divorce and everything

489
00:44:25.100 --> 00:44:29.670
Christian: I don't know how to put this where it won't sound shitty, but.

490
00:44:29.670 --> 00:44:30.220
Kenneth Matthew Warner: Okay.

491
00:44:31.360 --> 00:44:34.389
Christian: She needed some work that she didn't choose to do.

492
00:44:35.090 --> 00:44:42.000
Christian: So. The boys have kind of kept with me, if you will.

493
00:44:45.030 --> 00:44:50.499
Christian: But it, it's actually that relationship with the 2 boys is very good.

494
00:44:52.210 --> 00:44:57.160
Travis Rickford: So what's on your mind right now? And in terms of

495
00:44:57.680 --> 00:45:00.670
Travis Rickford: again using that analogy of putting on the mask

496
00:45:01.610 --> 00:45:07.940
Travis Rickford: for you like what's what's important to you right now, and in your mental and physical health.

497
00:45:11.070 --> 00:45:19.916
Christian: Mentally. I'm I feel like I'm in a good place physically. I am.

498
00:45:21.350 --> 00:45:26.629
Christian: I smoke cigarettes, and I'm 65 years old. I've done so for 50 years.

499
00:45:28.400 --> 00:45:32.763
Christian: That's a hard one to break, and then

500
00:45:35.500 --> 00:45:39.127
Christian: I'm working right now on cutting back on drinking.

501
00:45:40.630 --> 00:45:45.939
Christian: So I have a plan. I gotta stick to it, which is always the tough part.

502
00:45:48.620 --> 00:45:52.470
Travis Rickford: And so when? When is the last time that you've you've drank.

503
00:45:53.150 --> 00:45:54.980
Christian: 2 days ago.

504
00:45:55.770 --> 00:45:56.410
Travis Rickford: Okay?

505
00:45:56.570 --> 00:46:00.590
Travis Rickford: And so making some progress on on. That's really important to you. Right now.

506
00:46:00.740 --> 00:46:07.700
Christian: But definitely I'm trying. What I'm trying to execute on is drinking every other day, not every day.

507
00:46:09.480 --> 00:46:10.250
Christian: And and so.

508
00:46:11.060 --> 00:46:17.720
Travis Rickford: Christian describe your support network to me? What does that look like? Who do you it?

509
00:46:17.910 --> 00:46:20.770
Travis Rickford: Who do you have in your life that supports you?

510
00:46:21.499 --> 00:46:26.289
Christian: My significant other Sandy has been a gem.

511
00:46:27.096 --> 00:46:34.929
Christian: She understands me very well. We've been together for 10 years, and she supports me.

512
00:46:35.130 --> 00:46:39.310
Christian: and at times will be my little.

513
00:46:40.240 --> 00:46:45.860
Christian: you know voice in my head to say, Hey, you know you said you were. Gonna do this, but you're not

514
00:46:46.650 --> 00:46:48.749
Christian: so. She keeps me in balance.

515
00:46:50.580 --> 00:46:52.419
Travis Rickford: So does that.

516
00:46:52.610 --> 00:46:56.829
Travis Rickford: So you just explain this conversation. Is that what you were trying to

517
00:46:57.040 --> 00:47:01.660
Travis Rickford: back when you were you were married, and before the divorce, and you were trying to.

518
00:47:03.850 --> 00:47:06.829
Travis Rickford: Talk to your wife about making some changes.

519
00:47:07.340 --> 00:47:16.039
Travis Rickford: What? What? I I guess my 1st question is, what was, what were you? What? What were you trying to do there in that relationship? What needed to change with

520
00:47:16.320 --> 00:47:17.660
Travis Rickford: your wife?

521
00:47:23.040 --> 00:47:27.879
Christian: I felt she was narcissistic, but the counselor didn't agree.

522
00:47:28.890 --> 00:47:31.550
Christian: but she lived in her own bubble

523
00:47:32.050 --> 00:47:34.890
Christian: with no regard for anybody else.

524
00:47:35.170 --> 00:47:38.909
Christian: and she was one of those people that would be linked.

525
00:47:39.490 --> 00:47:45.019
Christian: She's going to be late to her own funeral, and that's the only positive about that.

526
00:47:45.910 --> 00:47:49.060
Christian: And so I you know, I we.

527
00:47:49.180 --> 00:47:53.769
Christian: my counselor, said, okay, we'll go to the concert without her.

528
00:47:53.960 --> 00:47:56.060
Christian: Well, I don't want to do that.

529
00:47:57.720 --> 00:48:00.019
Christian: So it got very, very frustrating

530
00:48:02.380 --> 00:48:13.460
Christian: that she never really put in an effort to acquiesce, or at least, you know.

531
00:48:13.690 --> 00:48:17.640
Christian: paint a picture that she was trying to appease me a little bit.

532
00:48:18.480 --> 00:48:27.119
Christian: and again very frustrating it. It finally turned me off to the point where I stopped working on it.

533
00:48:27.910 --> 00:48:28.600
Kenneth Matthew Warner: Oh!

534
00:48:28.770 --> 00:48:35.179
Travis Rickford: So when going back to the the drinking, were were you actively

535
00:48:35.400 --> 00:48:39.489
Travis Rickford: drinking during that time as well, or was? Or was that this just recently.

536
00:48:40.110 --> 00:48:43.759
Christian: No, I've pretty much drank my entire life.

537
00:48:44.170 --> 00:48:44.830
Travis Rickford: Okay.

538
00:48:45.530 --> 00:48:49.930
Travis Rickford: And when you, when you look at

539
00:48:50.680 --> 00:48:54.809
Travis Rickford: you're you're drinking on a scale of of one to 5.

540
00:48:54.960 --> 00:48:57.090
Travis Rickford: You know how important for it.

541
00:48:57.320 --> 00:49:02.469
Travis Rickford: How important for it! How important to you is it to quit right now.

542
00:49:05.480 --> 00:49:06.849
Christian: About a 3.

543
00:49:07.680 --> 00:49:08.430
Travis Rickford: Okay.

544
00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:15.589
Travis Rickford: And if that were, and if we were to move that 3 to a 4, what would that?

545
00:49:15.630 --> 00:49:19.319
Travis Rickford: What would that entail, or what would that look like.

546
00:49:22.480 --> 00:49:24.070
Christian: Less frequency.

547
00:49:25.730 --> 00:49:36.030
Travis Rickford: Okay, so and when when you look at less frequency, what?

548
00:49:36.750 --> 00:49:43.929
Travis Rickford: What have your your 2? Your 2 sons told you about your drinking. What have they expressed, as it relates to that.

549
00:49:45.410 --> 00:49:47.449
Christian: And I'm sorry my sons.

550
00:49:47.450 --> 00:49:48.180
Travis Rickford: Yeah.

551
00:49:48.180 --> 00:49:49.154
Travis Rickford: Yeah.

552
00:49:51.280 --> 00:49:58.619
Christian: The oldest has resigned himself to the fact that this is who I am, the younger one.

553
00:49:59.030 --> 00:50:03.080
Christian: I pissed him off so much that I had to make a promise that I wouldn't drink around him.

554
00:50:04.490 --> 00:50:10.850
Christian: and I've fulfilled both, or at least the one to the younger one.

555
00:50:12.060 --> 00:50:12.580
Kenneth Matthew Warner: Yeah.

556
00:50:12.960 --> 00:50:16.770
Travis Rickford: How often do you get together with them? Do do you.

557
00:50:17.660 --> 00:50:23.960
Christian: Well, we're in different cities. So it's physically, not frequently. But we're on the phone. Probably once a week.

558
00:50:25.330 --> 00:50:26.030
Travis Rickford: Okay.

559
00:50:26.860 --> 00:50:34.010
Travis Rickford: And so if you were to think about something that is going to build.

560
00:50:34.450 --> 00:50:40.669
Travis Rickford: rebuild some of those relationships with your family, drinking less will

561
00:50:40.880 --> 00:50:43.510
Travis Rickford: begin the process of doing that.

562
00:50:45.194 --> 00:50:45.870
Christian: Definitely.

563
00:50:46.080 --> 00:50:46.980
Travis Rickford: Okay?

564
00:50:47.490 --> 00:50:54.319
Travis Rickford: And what might be a a reasonable goal that you would.

565
00:50:56.500 --> 00:51:00.500
Travis Rickford: Wanna wanna look at. That would start moving you in that direction.

566
00:51:01.550 --> 00:51:02.430
Christian: Well,

567
00:51:05.200 --> 00:51:13.579
Christian: I don't really have physical problems with the drinking, like. I can go for days without drinking and not have tremors and things like that.

568
00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:31.400
Christian: However, mentally, I'm pacing myself every other day, and then what I'm going to do over probably the next. The course of this exercise that we're involved in. Cut it back to either 3 or 4 days a week, where I don't drink.

569
00:51:33.140 --> 00:51:37.010
Travis Rickford: And what's your long term goal? So

570
00:51:37.320 --> 00:51:43.100
Travis Rickford: in the, in the immediate, you want to drink less, do you eventually want to get to the point where you're not doing it at all.

571
00:51:43.800 --> 00:51:44.720
Christian: No.

572
00:51:48.460 --> 00:51:54.430
Travis Rickford: Any any barriers that would get in the way of the frequency of your drinking.

573
00:51:59.960 --> 00:52:01.330
Christian: habitual.

574
00:52:02.110 --> 00:52:04.409
Christian: It's a routine I go through

575
00:52:04.630 --> 00:52:07.530
Christian: at the end of the day, even though I don't work

576
00:52:08.203 --> 00:52:11.890
Christian: it's nice to have a couple of pops at the end of the day.

577
00:52:12.170 --> 00:52:17.169
Christian: And I have to fight that urge, or actually that habit.

578
00:52:18.720 --> 00:52:19.709
Christian: And

579
00:52:22.900 --> 00:52:32.500
Christian: I'm also trying to commit myself more to volunteering, which

580
00:52:33.490 --> 00:52:38.779
Christian: makes me need to be sharp, and, you know, awake and motivated

581
00:52:39.110 --> 00:52:42.230
Christian: at 8 in the morning, as opposed to 9 or 10.

582
00:52:43.580 --> 00:52:46.990
Travis Rickford: So, having more activities to do and and schedule

583
00:52:48.810 --> 00:52:51.160
Travis Rickford: helps with your goal to drink less.

584
00:52:51.823 --> 00:52:56.710
Christian: Definitely, because it squeezes out the boredom.

585
00:52:57.900 --> 00:52:58.830
Christian: And

586
00:53:03.340 --> 00:53:08.010
Stacey Ford: And it feels good to do good things, you know.

587
00:53:09.720 --> 00:53:10.720
Christian: Oh, I'm sorry!

588
00:53:11.810 --> 00:53:26.119
Stacey Ford: And it feels good to do that to do good things. And then it, you know, after doing that, you feel great. It's it's better than not. It's better than drinking.

589
00:53:26.120 --> 00:53:27.065
Christian: Oh, for sure!

590
00:53:27.380 --> 00:53:37.419
Stacey Ford: You know. Volunteer. Yeah, doing doing that. Volunteering makes you feel good, and it sorry to interrupt you.

591
00:53:37.420 --> 00:53:43.200
Travis Rickford: No, that that's fine that you bring up an interesting question, Stacy, and I want to open that up to the entire group

592
00:53:43.970 --> 00:53:50.620
Travis Rickford: when when you're looking at quitting a harmful activity.

593
00:53:51.280 --> 00:53:57.009
Travis Rickford: What are some strategies that worked for you? To be to begin to begin doing that?

594
00:53:59.560 --> 00:54:02.510
Travis Rickford: And this is for anyone anyone can answer.

595
00:54:05.375 --> 00:54:09.520
Kenneth Matthew Warner: I I had to check myself into rehab for me to quit.

596
00:54:11.500 --> 00:54:12.239
Michael Whale: Yeah, me, too.

597
00:54:14.060 --> 00:54:14.720
Travis Rickford: And.

598
00:54:14.830 --> 00:54:15.710
Stacey Ford: What was?

599
00:54:15.710 --> 00:54:17.700
Stacey Ford: Can you repeat the question?

600
00:54:17.770 --> 00:54:19.930
Stacey Ford: Can you repeat the question? Please?

601
00:54:20.140 --> 00:54:28.120
Travis Rickford: Yeah, I asked, what strategies? That you all had implemented to begin that step, and.

602
00:54:28.120 --> 00:54:35.810
Stacey Ford: One big strategy for me was to be so disgusted dealing with my ex

603
00:54:36.100 --> 00:54:50.520
Stacey Ford: going through life with him and being so fed up with it, and to the point where I just it's not a fun thing, you know. And and that's like, that's that's regarding alcohol, you know, I don't.

604
00:54:52.373 --> 00:54:56.920
Stacey Ford: But yeah, being so fed up and tired of it.

605
00:54:57.120 --> 00:55:03.060
Stacey Ford: and just totally it makes you hate it. It's not fun, it's not enjoyable

606
00:55:03.160 --> 00:55:05.310
Stacey Ford: at all. That's how I feel.

607
00:55:06.146 --> 00:55:20.550
Stacey Ford: Not that I don't drink because I do. But you know, regarding being fed up with him and being done with him, and the way that he parties and all that

608
00:55:22.280 --> 00:55:24.439
Stacey Ford: being fed up with it.

609
00:55:26.130 --> 00:55:32.359
Travis Rickford: And Kenneth and and, Michael, you you shared that your 1st step was making that decision to

610
00:55:33.750 --> 00:55:40.860
Travis Rickford: go into rehab. Was that the initial step? Or was that your very 1st step, or was there something else that happened before you made the decision to do that.

611
00:55:41.240 --> 00:55:42.770
Michael Whale: Well, I went to the hospital and.

612
00:55:42.770 --> 00:55:43.230
Kenneth Matthew Warner: Yeah.

613
00:55:43.230 --> 00:55:45.539
Michael Whale: Yeah, check myself into the psych ward.

614
00:55:46.410 --> 00:55:48.430
Michael Whale: And then from there I went to the rehab.

615
00:55:49.820 --> 00:55:55.500
Travis Rickford: And and, Michael, I I see that Christian left. But, Michael, how? How are things now?

616
00:55:56.930 --> 00:55:58.630
Travis Rickford: How are things going for you right now?

617
00:56:00.210 --> 00:56:05.780
Michael Whale: I'm still trying to work it out. So I mean, it's not easy. It's not like something that's just gonna disappear. So.

618
00:56:06.910 --> 00:56:10.800
Travis Rickford: And in terms of the.

619
00:56:11.260 --> 00:56:15.799
Travis Rickford: the the use of different substances. How is how is that right now? Are you

620
00:56:16.050 --> 00:56:18.790
Travis Rickford: clean, or are you still looking through.

621
00:56:18.790 --> 00:56:24.690
Michael Whale: Not for the most part I'm clean, I mean better than I was before. So like I would need something

622
00:56:25.510 --> 00:56:29.429
Michael Whale: to get me by today, like through today. You know what I mean. So

623
00:56:30.180 --> 00:56:36.900
Michael Whale: but I'm taking it day by day. I mean, I'm taking medication for depression and anxiety and all that. So.

624
00:56:38.399 --> 00:56:38.849
Stacey Ford: It's.

625
00:56:38.850 --> 00:56:40.440
Travis Rickford: And when you think of, and when.

626
00:56:40.440 --> 00:56:40.770
Stacey Ford: You can.

627
00:56:40.770 --> 00:56:47.760
Travis Rickford: Something that's really important to you right now, in terms of where

628
00:56:47.760 --> 00:56:51.979
Travis Rickford: you're at. What? What is that? What's important to you right now.

629
00:56:52.564 --> 00:57:02.930
Michael Whale: To be in a better relationship with my kids, my girlfriend now, I mean, she's pretty much like over over what I'm doing right now, but she's always there for me, no matter what

630
00:57:03.160 --> 00:57:08.759
Michael Whale: I get. I just gotta take everything for, you know. You know, I just gotta be more appreciative more

631
00:57:09.360 --> 00:57:16.090
Michael Whale: the old boy in life, I guess, so. I didn't care about myself at all for a long, the longest time.

632
00:57:16.650 --> 00:57:17.730
Michael Whale: and.

633
00:57:17.730 --> 00:57:18.290
Kenneth Matthew Warner: Shit.

634
00:57:18.440 --> 00:57:23.689
Michael Whale: I'm just trying to get back to, you know, being, I guess, quote unquote, normal.

635
00:57:24.300 --> 00:57:25.170
Kenneth Matthew Warner: Hmm.

636
00:57:25.170 --> 00:57:28.320
Travis Rickford: So. So tell me how you're you're putting on your

637
00:57:28.450 --> 00:57:34.159
Travis Rickford: your mask, so to speak. What are some things that you're doing to take care of your yourself, and what you need.

638
00:57:34.880 --> 00:57:41.069
Michael Whale: I gotta take my medication because I don't know every time I would take medication. I don't think it wasn't working, you know what I mean.

639
00:57:41.620 --> 00:57:42.020
Michael Whale: But

640
00:57:43.070 --> 00:57:47.780
Michael Whale: I you know I I just never give it a chance. So I I've been taking it. I I

641
00:57:47.980 --> 00:57:49.680
Michael Whale: I feel a little bit different.

642
00:57:49.900 --> 00:57:50.440
Michael Whale: But

643
00:57:51.470 --> 00:57:56.970
Michael Whale: you know, I mostly I just gotta get my life back in order. It's just I'm just. It's always chaos.

644
00:57:56.990 --> 00:57:59.049
Michael Whale: I'm just tired of it. So.

645
00:58:00.340 --> 00:58:03.970
Travis Rickford: And what might be a a 1st step in in doing that.

646
00:58:05.310 --> 00:58:07.896
Michael Whale: I'll just, you know. I'll just

647
00:58:08.930 --> 00:58:12.150
Michael Whale: make sure everything is, you know my life, my! I have to

648
00:58:12.560 --> 00:58:16.890
Michael Whale: to care about my kids. You care about my girlfriend. I I know I gotta care about myself more

649
00:58:17.180 --> 00:58:24.319
Michael Whale: so and and I'm working on that. It's it's it's a working process right now. So.

650
00:58:24.320 --> 00:58:27.839
Travis Rickford: Okay, what are what are some things that you're that you're trying out.

651
00:58:30.031 --> 00:58:36.320
Michael Whale: Well, 1st of all medication, and then secondly, I guess I never really was one for meetings, but

652
00:58:37.120 --> 00:58:50.290
Michael Whale: I mean I I don't mind. Small groups like the big groups like when I went to rehab like the big groups, is just a waste of time to me, because it's always the same people talking, and it just gets rowdy, you know, and it depends what rehab you. Go to you, too, you know.

653
00:58:50.780 --> 00:58:55.350
Michael Whale: So the rehab I went to wasn't the greatest. It was more jail run than anything, so.

654
00:58:57.780 --> 00:59:02.789
Travis Rickford: What? What do you enjoy doing? What are some things that you enjoy? Hobbies or

655
00:59:04.280 --> 00:59:12.530
Michael Whale: Well, I like to work. I try, you know. I mean, that's 1 of my things. I do. I do. I mean, I always thought money was everything, but I guess not anymore.

656
00:59:12.948 --> 00:59:22.340
Michael Whale: I don't know. I mean, I like, hang out with my kids going to the parks and stuff. You know what I mean? Just you know, I just want a normal life. So yeah.

657
00:59:23.101 --> 00:59:26.970
Travis Rickford: You said you like to work. Is that what you what? What do you do?

658
00:59:27.050 --> 00:59:28.070
Travis Rickford: What do you do for.

659
00:59:28.420 --> 00:59:30.339
Michael Whale: Truck driver. Yeah.

660
00:59:31.030 --> 00:59:33.969
Travis Rickford: And how do you do you like your job and enjoy it?

661
00:59:34.870 --> 00:59:43.178
Michael Whale: No, I mean I I did in the beginning. So I was over the road truck driver, and now I'm just tired of being over the road. I gets lonely, so lonely, and

662
00:59:44.150 --> 00:59:48.459
Michael Whale: you know I I have too much freedom. I could do whatever I want. You know what I mean like

663
00:59:48.680 --> 00:59:59.280
Michael Whale: that. I could drink anytime. I could use anytime. You know what I mean. It's just I I need stability in my life. That's 1 thing I did never had. Even when I was a teenager. I just I always did whatever I wanted.

664
00:59:59.440 --> 01:00:00.769
Travis Rickford: There's no guidance.

665
01:00:00.920 --> 01:00:01.740
Michael Whale: So.

666
01:00:03.040 --> 01:00:06.590
Travis Rickford: So let's let's take this off in in chunks. If we were to

667
01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:10.369
Travis Rickford: when we come together next week or next a week from today?

668
01:00:13.100 --> 01:00:16.550
Travis Rickford: What what might, what might look different?

669
01:00:20.181 --> 01:00:25.010
Michael Whale: I'm not a hundred percent sure. I mean, I I can hope for things, but

670
01:00:25.050 --> 01:00:29.450
Michael Whale: I don't know. I mean, I just just be more happier. I guess so.

671
01:00:29.810 --> 01:00:32.014
Travis Rickford: Is there some activity that you could try?

672
01:00:32.500 --> 01:00:35.424
Travis Rickford: we have. We have the holidays coming up.

673
01:00:36.220 --> 01:00:39.479
Travis Rickford: do you? Do you get to interact with your children quite a bit.

674
01:00:40.340 --> 01:00:47.690
Michael Whale: Yeah, I mean, there's really no custody thing with that. It's pretty much my fault with that, because you know about using and all that drinking and.

675
01:00:47.690 --> 01:00:48.610
Stacey Ford: Hold on!

676
01:00:48.730 --> 01:00:50.210
Michael Whale: So warm, everybody.

677
01:00:50.900 --> 01:00:56.259
Stacey Ford: Yeah, but a lot of it was my fault. I mean, I can't. You know. I mean me and me and their mother. It's just.

678
01:00:56.920 --> 01:01:01.920
Michael Whale: You know it. It's just complicated with that. But you know, my kids, it's just.

679
01:01:02.580 --> 01:01:11.800
Michael Whale: you know. I mean, they they love me unconditionally. You know what I mean. So I mean, they've been all the things I've done to them, and you know, not being not being there, you know it's just.

680
01:01:12.610 --> 01:01:18.359
Michael Whale: It's they still say they love me, which I don't understand. Why sometimes, but I mean

681
01:01:19.010 --> 01:01:20.830
Michael Whale: that's our conditional, I guess right.

682
01:01:22.130 --> 01:01:28.439
Travis Rickford: Is there any activities that you can do together that would help you and and them.

683
01:01:30.410 --> 01:01:44.179
Michael Whale: Yeah, I mean, I could figure some things out. I always thought just buying them stuff would just make them happy when I was like out driving like what like, you know, I'll be out for months at a time, and then I'll come back, and I'll just bring them to the Mall and be like, all right, Dude, get what you want, and

684
01:01:44.320 --> 01:01:46.499
Michael Whale: but that that doesn't bring them.

685
01:01:46.720 --> 01:01:50.710
Michael Whale: It does, you know. I mean, it's just. I'm just buying a lot at that point. You know what I mean.

686
01:01:52.060 --> 01:01:56.389
Travis Rickford: What might be a meaningful activity that you all could do together.

687
01:01:58.420 --> 01:02:01.480
Travis Rickford: between now and next week might what might be something you could try.

688
01:02:03.435 --> 01:02:06.040
Michael Whale: I don't know. I don't know yet.

689
01:02:06.870 --> 01:02:09.670
Michael Whale: but I mean I'll I'll think of it so so.

690
01:02:09.670 --> 01:02:16.180
Travis Rickford: Okay, does that. Does that sound like something that would be achievable before

691
01:02:17.290 --> 01:02:20.390
Travis Rickford: before we come together next week is to find an activity.

692
01:02:20.390 --> 01:02:25.490
Michael Whale: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. I mean, I'll let you know next week. So.

693
01:02:25.920 --> 01:02:26.650
Travis Rickford: Okay.

694
01:02:26.900 --> 01:02:29.019
Michael Whale: All right. Shannon Gina.

695
01:02:29.160 --> 01:02:33.009
Travis Rickford: Or Kenneth. We haven't gotten to you, and I want to make sure that we do

696
01:02:33.640 --> 01:02:35.830
Travis Rickford: before the end of the day. What's what's on your mind?

697
01:02:36.420 --> 01:02:39.319
Travis Rickford: Anyone, Shannon, Gina, or Kenneth can go.

698
01:02:40.150 --> 01:02:46.180
Kenneth Matthew Warner: I me and my girl we both went to rehab.

699
01:02:46.800 --> 01:02:52.539
Kenneth Matthew Warner: and we're working on our relationship because the drugs just about killed us. To be honest.

700
01:02:53.380 --> 01:02:57.210
Kenneth Matthew Warner: I mean, and when you care about somebody so much, and then

701
01:02:57.310 --> 01:03:01.000
Kenneth Matthew Warner: let drugs get in the way of that, you know it's awful.

702
01:03:01.440 --> 01:03:06.869
Kenneth Matthew Warner: So both of us went, and both of us are working on our sales.

703
01:03:07.290 --> 01:03:15.430
Kenneth Matthew Warner: I'm definitely more than her, because I had the mental issues also to go with that that I've never

704
01:03:15.470 --> 01:03:18.390
Kenneth Matthew Warner: been diagnosed with until I was in the rehab.

705
01:03:18.670 --> 01:03:23.439
Kenneth Matthew Warner: So now I'm on like 8 different medications, and

706
01:03:23.820 --> 01:03:28.840
Kenneth Matthew Warner: you know it's a work in progress right? And she is.

707
01:03:28.840 --> 01:03:29.370
Travis Rickford: You said you.

708
01:03:29.370 --> 01:03:33.699
Kenneth Matthew Warner: Me, you know, and I'm supportive of her.

709
01:03:34.670 --> 01:03:35.550
Kenneth Matthew Warner: So.

710
01:03:37.670 --> 01:03:39.353
Travis Rickford: Sorry to interrupt you there.

711
01:03:39.770 --> 01:03:42.789
Travis Rickford: You! You had mentioned that you had just got out of rehab

712
01:03:45.010 --> 01:03:46.959
Kenneth Matthew Warner: Correct. How? How recent was that?

713
01:03:48.110 --> 01:03:49.850
Kenneth Matthew Warner: October the 23.rd

714
01:03:49.990 --> 01:03:52.729
Travis Rickford: Okay, what is your relationship? Right?

715
01:03:52.840 --> 01:03:55.560
Travis Rickford: Right right now with your your girlfriend?

716
01:03:56.906 --> 01:04:06.499
Kenneth Matthew Warner: It's getting better. I mean, it's wonderful. Actually it. There's no drugs involved. And we can focus on each other finally.

717
01:04:07.410 --> 01:04:10.360
Kenneth Matthew Warner: And and it's a work in progress.

718
01:04:11.990 --> 01:04:18.339
Travis Rickford: And when you think of things that are really important to you right now, is that relationship with your girlfriend sort of

719
01:04:18.650 --> 01:04:22.470
Travis Rickford: top of mind? Or is there something else that is really important to you?

720
01:04:22.470 --> 01:04:29.577
Kenneth Matthew Warner: That that is, that's a number one, you know, to me, because

721
01:04:30.360 --> 01:04:34.800
Kenneth Matthew Warner: I mean we love each other, and it's it's great.

722
01:04:35.040 --> 01:04:37.040
Kenneth Matthew Warner: and it's a shame that we

723
01:04:37.120 --> 01:04:40.469
Kenneth Matthew Warner: got to the point where it almost destroyed us, you know.

724
01:04:40.890 --> 01:04:44.229
Kenneth Matthew Warner: and and both of us are guilty from drug use.

725
01:04:45.010 --> 01:04:51.990
Kenneth Matthew Warner: But we both realized it, and we both seen it, and we both went to rehab. So

726
01:04:52.700 --> 01:04:54.799
Kenneth Matthew Warner: that's how much we care about each other.

727
01:04:55.410 --> 01:04:58.779
Kenneth Matthew Warner: and a lot of people don't have that support, and I know that.

728
01:04:58.960 --> 01:05:01.809
Kenneth Matthew Warner: But I do, and I think it's great.

729
01:05:04.160 --> 01:05:06.979
Travis Rickford: And so do you both live together.

730
01:05:08.361 --> 01:05:10.270
Kenneth Matthew Warner: Yes, now we're back together.

731
01:05:10.670 --> 01:05:11.290
Travis Rickford: Okay.

732
01:05:11.290 --> 01:05:18.060
Kenneth Matthew Warner: Yeah, back together. Now, before we went to rehab, I had moved out because of the drug use.

733
01:05:18.390 --> 01:05:21.489
Kenneth Matthew Warner: and it was just all bad, you know.

734
01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:23.720
Kenneth Matthew Warner: So.

735
01:05:23.720 --> 01:05:26.530
Travis Rickford: So is there? There's something that you can

736
01:05:26.910 --> 01:05:31.770
Travis Rickford: do together, since you both are in that post. Rehab that would

737
01:05:33.980 --> 01:05:37.859
Travis Rickford: that would help both of you so to speak. Is there anything that you're doing.

738
01:05:39.060 --> 01:05:46.770
Kenneth Matthew Warner: Well, I mean where I'm going to counseling, and I'm taking my medication like I'm supposed to, and

739
01:05:47.430 --> 01:05:58.880
Kenneth Matthew Warner: she's in outpatient treatment. I'm in outpatient treatment. So and we're just focusing on each other completely and and are there for each other. And

740
01:05:59.770 --> 01:06:02.849
Kenneth Matthew Warner: without her I couldn't get through it. I don't think just to be honest.

741
01:06:04.400 --> 01:06:11.290
Travis Rickford: So just being consistent with that post, rehab assistance and help.

742
01:06:11.610 --> 01:06:17.480
Travis Rickford: That's your main priority right now. Is that am I reading that right.

743
01:06:17.480 --> 01:06:18.670
Kenneth Matthew Warner: Yes.

744
01:06:18.850 --> 01:06:27.459
Kenneth Matthew Warner: yes, that's that's correct. The outpatient treatment and my my counseling, no matter how long it takes, I'm gonna stick with it.

745
01:06:27.540 --> 01:06:34.549
Kenneth Matthew Warner: you know I was. I honestly done drugs for 35 years and every drug imaginable.

746
01:06:35.113 --> 01:06:44.830
Kenneth Matthew Warner: I quit drinking on my own 16 years ago because I went to the store 1 1 time and bought me a 30 pack and stayed drunk for 10 years.

747
01:06:45.420 --> 01:06:55.190
Kenneth Matthew Warner: and that's exactly what I've done. So 16 years ago I quit that. But the substance abuse continued, and just progressively got worse.

748
01:06:55.340 --> 01:06:59.670
Kenneth Matthew Warner: So, and it's great that she's supportive.

749
01:07:02.010 --> 01:07:07.700
Travis Rickford: And how can this group help you? What, what can be? What can be some things that this group can do to

750
01:07:08.200 --> 01:07:10.649
Travis Rickford: assist you over the next few weeks.

751
01:07:11.550 --> 01:07:17.469
Kenneth Matthew Warner: I I really don't have other than my counselors anybody to talk to, because I don't have any friends where I live.

752
01:07:17.970 --> 01:07:21.889
Kenneth Matthew Warner: and I'm not very sociable to start with.

753
01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:25.739
Kenneth Matthew Warner: I'm I'm I'm a lone wolf, and always have been

754
01:07:26.490 --> 01:07:29.139
Kenneth Matthew Warner: so just somebody to talk to.

755
01:07:29.350 --> 01:07:31.280
Kenneth Matthew Warner: you know, and share this with

756
01:07:35.630 --> 01:07:40.600
Christian: Well, hey, man, if I can just say good work so far, man.

757
01:07:42.390 --> 01:07:43.510
Stacey Ford: Me too.

758
01:07:46.360 --> 01:07:47.310
Kenneth Matthew Warner: Thank you.

759
01:07:48.377 --> 01:07:49.750
Kenneth Matthew Warner: It's a struggle.

760
01:07:49.820 --> 01:07:53.739
Kenneth Matthew Warner: And honestly, I couldn't do it without my metis. Just to be honest.

761
01:07:53.790 --> 01:08:02.020
Kenneth Matthew Warner: that's medically assisted treatment for you guys that don't know. I take once a month brixoty shot, which is for my opiate abuse

762
01:08:02.590 --> 01:08:08.790
Kenneth Matthew Warner: over the years, and and without it there's no way I could do it. Period.

763
01:08:11.240 --> 01:08:11.920
Kenneth Matthew Warner: Excuse me.

764
01:08:11.920 --> 01:08:15.060
Travis Rickford: Well, well, thank you, Matthew.

765
01:08:15.060 --> 01:08:27.090
Stacey Ford: I'm really proud of you for going through this and and being positive. And and you're gonna make it keep doing what you're doing. You're doing the right thing.

766
01:08:28.950 --> 01:08:29.680
Kenneth Matthew Warner: Thank you.

767
01:08:31.580 --> 01:08:33.289
Travis Rickford: Shannon, or or Gina.

768
01:08:35.040 --> 01:08:39.149
Travis Rickford: What's on your mind, Gina? I see you talking, and the the mute button.

769
01:08:42.149 --> 01:08:44.779
Gina Knepp: Okay, there, I forgot. I was on mute.

770
01:08:45.504 --> 01:08:50.179
Gina Knepp: I kind of have the same thing going as Kenneth did.

771
01:08:50.249 --> 01:08:59.127
Gina Knepp: But, my boyfriend, he is on the side of not wanting to quit doing drugs and stuff and

772
01:08:59.679 --> 01:09:08.749
Gina Knepp: well, we live together, and it's been really kind of hard to like. He'll leave late at night whenever I'm there with kids. And then during the day he doesn't have a job.

773
01:09:09.149 --> 01:09:13.039
Gina Knepp: and he hasn't had a job for a long time, and

774
01:09:13.499 --> 01:09:18.849
Gina Knepp: he goes out and does whatever he wants. And I'm there with kids, and it gets really frustrating.

775
01:09:18.909 --> 01:09:21.639
Gina Knepp: and I don't want to leave him because I love him

776
01:09:22.039 --> 01:09:25.029
Gina Knepp: and the kids that's their dad. So

777
01:09:25.849 --> 01:09:36.549
Gina Knepp: I'm kind of. That's where I get my my depression and my anxiety and my like. I don't know. I get so mad, but I don't get mad. I don't know how you explain it like a

778
01:09:37.129 --> 01:09:41.299
Gina Knepp: like something towards him like, and it makes I don't know. It makes it to where

779
01:09:42.229 --> 01:09:45.689
Gina Knepp: we don't get along very well sometimes, so I don't.

780
01:09:46.439 --> 01:09:48.129
Travis Rickford: And how old are your kiddos?

781
01:09:48.694 --> 01:09:54.039
Gina Knepp: There, I have 2 boys that are 2 years old, and I have a little girl. She's 4 years old.

782
01:09:54.660 --> 01:09:56.289
Travis Rickford: Okay. What are what are their names?

783
01:09:56.590 --> 01:09:58.600
Gina Knepp: Cash and crew and jada.

784
01:09:59.130 --> 01:10:01.227
Travis Rickford: Oh, I like I like all of those names.

785
01:10:01.460 --> 01:10:02.070
Gina Knepp: Yes.

786
01:10:02.400 --> 01:10:03.740
Stacey Ford: Super, cute.

787
01:10:04.060 --> 01:10:04.430
Travis Rickford: What

788
01:10:04.800 --> 01:10:05.920
Gina Knepp: Yes. Yeah.

789
01:10:05.920 --> 01:10:11.030
Travis Rickford: What, Gina, what supports do you have in in your life?

790
01:10:11.690 --> 01:10:17.499
Gina Knepp: Well, I want to be married to him, and I want to like raise our family and

791
01:10:17.870 --> 01:10:21.550
Gina Knepp: be good and be normal, or I mean I

792
01:10:21.930 --> 01:10:24.980
Gina Knepp: it's not normal now. I don't feel like

793
01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:29.549
Gina Knepp: I mean, I'm 34. I want to be married. I mean, every girl wants to get married.

794
01:10:30.030 --> 01:10:38.519
Gina Knepp: and he's he's actually he's divorced and has 2 other kids with someone else. And I think I'm the reason for that

795
01:10:38.560 --> 01:10:43.119
Gina Knepp: break up. But I don't know, I just want to be normal and

796
01:10:43.840 --> 01:10:46.230
Gina Knepp: us to be in a good relationship.

797
01:10:47.430 --> 01:10:50.839
Travis Rickford: And what I mean by supports is do you have like a

798
01:10:52.270 --> 01:10:55.410
Travis Rickford: a support system? What does your support system look like?

799
01:10:55.690 --> 01:10:58.139
Travis Rickford: Do you have anyone. You frequently talk to.

800
01:10:58.730 --> 01:10:59.830
Gina Knepp: Not really no.

801
01:11:00.870 --> 01:11:01.859
Travis Rickford: Okay. So it's just.

802
01:11:03.930 --> 01:11:04.970
Gina Knepp: Go ahead!

803
01:11:05.180 --> 01:11:07.400
Travis Rickford: Now as well say a best friend or.

804
01:11:09.240 --> 01:11:14.510
Gina Knepp: I have a I have a friend one. I have like one friend, and she's

805
01:11:14.520 --> 01:11:18.499
Gina Knepp: she's not that great to talk to, because she's pretty messed up herself.

806
01:11:19.215 --> 01:11:28.140
Gina Knepp: But I mean she's there for like the girl time. So if we need like a little girl talk, or I just need to get stuff off my mind. She's there to listen for sure.

807
01:11:28.440 --> 01:11:31.290
Gina Knepp: But my family! I don't

808
01:11:31.880 --> 01:11:35.609
Gina Knepp: really like to talk about it to them, because they? I mean they

809
01:11:36.730 --> 01:11:41.200
Gina Knepp: that we grew. I grew up in a like a really good family like Amish midnight.

810
01:11:41.330 --> 01:11:44.389
Gina Knepp: And yeah, they

811
01:11:45.320 --> 01:11:50.829
Gina Knepp: I don't know. I just like if I would say something to them, they would probably look down on me or so. I don't know how to.

812
01:11:54.340 --> 01:11:55.310
Stacey Ford: You.

813
01:11:55.450 --> 01:12:00.960
Stacey Ford: You can call me time. I'll give you my number. So you someone.

814
01:12:01.160 --> 01:12:01.800
Gina Knepp: Alright!

815
01:12:01.800 --> 01:12:05.809
Stacey Ford: And I'm serious anytime.

816
01:12:06.990 --> 01:12:08.390
Gina Knepp: That's good. Thank you.

817
01:12:09.350 --> 01:12:09.910
Stacey Ford: Year, one.

818
01:12:11.560 --> 01:12:18.650
Travis Rickford: Gina back to you. You were talking about your your family's background.

819
01:12:19.270 --> 01:12:25.340
Travis Rickford: Is it your perception that they they wouldn't talk to you or.

820
01:12:25.340 --> 01:12:26.100
Gina Knepp: Probably.

821
01:12:26.100 --> 01:12:27.809
Travis Rickford: Or has that actually happened.

822
01:12:28.320 --> 01:12:31.289
Gina Knepp: No, probably this is probably me.

823
01:12:31.940 --> 01:12:33.417
Gina Knepp: It's probably me.

824
01:12:34.430 --> 01:12:35.239
Travis Rickford: Is there a.

825
01:12:35.240 --> 01:12:40.790
Gina Knepp: I was the oldest of the family, and I was the one that was always in trouble, or

826
01:12:40.980 --> 01:12:44.799
Gina Knepp: being wild, or whatever, and the rest like I have

827
01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:49.109
Gina Knepp: 4 sisters or 3 sisters and a brother, and they all are like

828
01:12:49.180 --> 01:12:54.370
Gina Knepp: like perfect, almost like they never did anything like I've done. I don't know. Maybe it's just a

829
01:12:54.620 --> 01:12:56.459
Gina Knepp: it's just what I think. I guess.

830
01:12:58.010 --> 01:13:00.930
Travis Rickford: So. Is there anyone in your your family where.

831
01:13:01.090 --> 01:13:02.189
Gina Knepp: You might.

832
01:13:02.830 --> 01:13:04.809
Travis Rickford: Try and experiment to

833
01:13:06.320 --> 01:13:08.119
Gina Knepp: Have a conversation, and.

834
01:13:08.350 --> 01:13:11.170
Travis Rickford: And maybe it's not a conversation about

835
01:13:11.600 --> 01:13:17.939
Travis Rickford: any of your issues at all. But just to to start to rebuild some of those relationships. Is there anyone in your family that you can

836
01:13:19.530 --> 01:13:22.199
Travis Rickford: start that with? Who who would that be?

837
01:13:23.325 --> 01:13:30.389
Gina Knepp: Probably my my sister Janice. She would be like 2 years younger than I would be, so

838
01:13:30.750 --> 01:13:32.620
Gina Knepp: should be like the closest one. I think.

839
01:13:33.930 --> 01:13:34.460
Kenneth Matthew Warner: She's.

840
01:13:34.460 --> 01:13:36.350
Travis Rickford: And when's the last time you talked to Janice.

841
01:13:36.880 --> 01:13:42.330
Gina Knepp: Well, I talked to her actually, today, but it's not. It wasn't about any of that what I was saying.

842
01:13:42.560 --> 01:13:52.100
Gina Knepp: It was like I I come here. I'm at my I'm actually at my parents now. I come here every Wednesday to bring the kids and let them see their

843
01:13:52.210 --> 01:13:53.480
Gina Knepp: grandpa and grandma.

844
01:13:53.520 --> 01:13:54.145
Kenneth Matthew Warner: And

845
01:13:55.420 --> 01:14:01.100
Gina Knepp: I just don't really like talk about my life and my struggles much with them.

846
01:14:02.670 --> 01:14:06.574
Travis Rickford: And if you were to set aside some time with Janice

847
01:14:07.240 --> 01:14:11.680
Travis Rickford: Oh, is there something you enjoy doing together? You and Janice.

848
01:14:13.081 --> 01:14:19.099
Gina Knepp: Yeah, I guess. Go. We thrift thrift store shopping. I don't know.

849
01:14:19.830 --> 01:14:22.210
Travis Rickford: Is there? Is there any way that

850
01:14:23.870 --> 01:14:29.763
Travis Rickford: If if we had more time we would actually we could. We could test the conversation, see what it would look like. But

851
01:14:30.490 --> 01:14:36.500
Travis Rickford: What what might that conversation look like if you were to say, Janice, I really need to visit with you about something.

852
01:14:37.020 --> 01:14:40.990
Travis Rickford: How do you think Janice would respond to that.

853
01:14:42.290 --> 01:14:48.100
Gina Knepp: Probably good. She would probably be like, Okay, yeah, let's let's go. Let's talk. What? What's up? I don't know.

854
01:14:49.430 --> 01:14:55.020
Travis Rickford: Is that an experiment that feels comfortable to try between now and and next week?

855
01:14:55.470 --> 01:14:56.830
Gina Knepp: Yeah, I could try it.

856
01:14:57.620 --> 01:14:58.850
Kenneth Matthew Warner: Okay. Yeah.

857
01:14:58.850 --> 01:15:02.160
Travis Rickford: And and before we go to Shannon I'll I'll tell you

858
01:15:02.180 --> 01:15:08.457
Travis Rickford: each of you, when we. I'll send you an email throughout the week, just to check in. See how things are going. But

859
01:15:08.810 --> 01:15:13.070
Travis Rickford: At the beginning of the meeting next week we'll actually debrief on how our weeks went, and

860
01:15:13.190 --> 01:15:16.829
Travis Rickford: and make some changes or pivot if we need to.

861
01:15:18.110 --> 01:15:20.649
Travis Rickford: All right, Shannon, what's on? What's on your mind?

862
01:15:24.420 --> 01:15:25.690
Travis Rickford: Oh, you're on mute, too.

863
01:15:27.290 --> 01:15:29.780
Travis Rickford: I know that. Dang mute button. I I do it all the time.

864
01:15:30.670 --> 01:15:31.540
Shannon: How about now?

865
01:15:32.050 --> 01:15:32.799
Travis Rickford: Yes, we can hear you.

866
01:15:34.774 --> 01:15:40.069
Shannon: Let's see. Well, I guess I'm gonna sound kind of like I'm repeating the last 2 people here.

867
01:15:40.190 --> 01:15:44.169
Shannon: But has to do with my relationship.

868
01:15:45.320 --> 01:15:48.800
Shannon: Let's see, I've been married for 14 years.

869
01:15:49.320 --> 01:15:52.980
Shannon: and my husband, he's always been an addict and

870
01:15:53.740 --> 01:15:57.480
Shannon: about like like I said before, 10 years ago, you know.

871
01:15:57.480 --> 01:15:58.000
Kenneth Matthew Warner: Bye.

872
01:15:59.010 --> 01:16:00.080
Shannon: We started them.

873
01:16:01.250 --> 01:16:06.340
Shannon: I don't know. I started using along with him and anymore, like.

874
01:16:06.670 --> 01:16:08.670
Shannon: it's kind of like a daily battle to.

875
01:16:08.890 --> 01:16:11.112
Shannon: you know, I'd like to try and

876
01:16:11.560 --> 01:16:15.149
Shannon: get him to get him to stop using, because I don't want to use anymore.

877
01:16:15.620 --> 01:16:23.330
Shannon: And you know, it's just I don't know. Our relationship could now improve some.

878
01:16:26.180 --> 01:16:27.840
Travis Rickford: And what's your husband's name?

879
01:16:28.840 --> 01:16:29.620
Shannon: Rob.

880
01:16:32.620 --> 01:16:38.559
Travis Rickford: Describe the frequency in which you use right now? Is it daily weekly? What does that look like.

881
01:16:40.084 --> 01:16:40.689
Shannon: Daily

882
01:16:46.020 --> 01:16:50.629
Shannon: for the longest time. I always you know. I mean, I felt that we had a really good relationship, and

883
01:16:50.650 --> 01:16:52.541
Shannon: we still do. It's just

884
01:16:54.380 --> 01:16:56.690
Shannon: It's just the. It's just the drugs.

885
01:16:56.830 --> 01:16:59.799
Shannon: and it doesn't help anything. And I know that.

886
01:16:59.800 --> 01:17:00.350
Stacey Ford: I mean.

887
01:17:01.050 --> 01:17:01.840
Shannon: So.

888
01:17:02.710 --> 01:17:06.470
Travis Rickford: So do. Do you both want to quit? What's your what's your.

889
01:17:06.470 --> 01:17:07.250
Shannon: Yeah.

890
01:17:07.250 --> 01:17:09.249
Travis Rickford: Interest level and and quitting.

891
01:17:09.250 --> 01:17:13.660
Shannon: Well, we both. We both want to quit as far as

892
01:17:14.030 --> 01:17:16.050
Shannon: I mean I do, for sure.

893
01:17:16.940 --> 01:17:18.630
Shannon: He says he does as well.

894
01:17:19.400 --> 01:17:23.525
Shannon: So you know, we're we're working on it, and

895
01:17:26.310 --> 01:17:28.790
Travis Rickford: You know what when you say you're.

896
01:17:28.790 --> 01:17:29.540
Shannon: Things.

897
01:17:29.750 --> 01:17:36.250
Shannon: Well, one of the things is we're working to to move like somewhere else, which I think if we had a

898
01:17:36.410 --> 01:17:38.520
Shannon: either like a fresh start somewhere else.

899
01:17:38.540 --> 01:17:40.281
Shannon: It would help a lot.

900
01:17:43.690 --> 01:17:51.550
Travis Rickford: And so what is the and what is the likelihood that you'd be able to move somewhere else?

901
01:17:53.630 --> 01:17:56.379
Shannon: Well, we're working on it. Probably

902
01:17:56.940 --> 01:18:00.139
Shannon: maybe in the next couple of weeks we'll probably be going somewhere.

903
01:18:00.722 --> 01:18:03.720
Shannon: He can. If he can find a good job in his

904
01:18:04.160 --> 01:18:06.479
Shannon: working for a tool and die.

905
01:18:09.330 --> 01:18:12.650
Travis Rickford: So what supports are you and your husband

906
01:18:13.060 --> 01:18:15.739
Travis Rickford: seeking right now to help you quit.

907
01:18:20.940 --> 01:18:25.859
Shannon: Oh, right now I mean

908
01:18:30.250 --> 01:18:32.490
Shannon: nothing really right now, just.

909
01:18:35.620 --> 01:18:41.129
Travis Rickford: And on a I'll use scale again on a scale of one to 5. How interested are you

910
01:18:41.860 --> 01:18:43.510
Travis Rickford: and finding those supports.

911
01:18:46.180 --> 01:18:51.490
Shannon: And well, me one on one like probably 5. Did you say? One to 5.

912
01:18:51.490 --> 01:18:52.210
Travis Rickford: Yeah.

913
01:18:54.225 --> 01:18:54.940
Shannon: 5.

914
01:18:54.940 --> 01:18:55.579
Travis Rickford: 0 to 5.

915
01:18:56.460 --> 01:18:56.980
Shannon: So.

916
01:18:56.980 --> 01:18:57.480
Travis Rickford: Cool.

917
01:18:57.690 --> 01:18:59.730
Travis Rickford: Well, let's let's start with you.

918
01:19:01.190 --> 01:19:04.709
Travis Rickford: again using the mask analogy. But what? What's something that you could

919
01:19:05.210 --> 01:19:07.960
Travis Rickford: that you could take the step towards that would.

920
01:19:09.140 --> 01:19:09.530
Kenneth Matthew Warner: That's it.

921
01:19:09.530 --> 01:19:15.490
Travis Rickford: Move you in that direction of of to quit using.

922
01:19:19.480 --> 01:19:20.000
Kenneth Matthew Warner: But not.

923
01:19:26.570 --> 01:19:33.909
Travis Rickford: Is there someone that you can reconnect with? Whether that be a a healthcare provider, or or a friend, or or someone.

924
01:19:35.610 --> 01:19:43.660
Shannon: Yeah, probably. Actually, there's few people in the past that I could like a like an old counselor

925
01:19:43.780 --> 01:19:44.860
Shannon: I can talk with.

926
01:19:46.210 --> 01:19:46.900
Shannon: Maybe.

927
01:19:48.040 --> 01:19:48.440
Travis Rickford: And

928
01:19:50.520 --> 01:19:53.020
Travis Rickford: What's the the likelihood that you could

929
01:19:54.800 --> 01:20:00.180
Travis Rickford: make a call to that counselor to set up an appointment between now and and next Wednesday.

930
01:20:01.690 --> 01:20:02.180
Kenneth Matthew Warner: Excuse me.

931
01:20:06.050 --> 01:20:07.270
Shannon: You know I mean.

932
01:20:08.030 --> 01:20:12.530
Shannon: I can usually try. I don't know. I don't know about their availability, but you know

933
01:20:12.890 --> 01:20:16.160
Shannon: I I would do that try and set something up.

934
01:20:17.970 --> 01:20:22.900
Travis Rickford: And do you and your I? And I'm sorry if I don't remember. Do you have any kids.

935
01:20:23.670 --> 01:20:28.080
Shannon: Yes, we have 2. They're not at our home in our home right now.

936
01:20:28.610 --> 01:20:29.950
Shannon: Okay, where? Where are they at?

937
01:20:29.950 --> 01:20:30.710
Shannon: So.

938
01:20:31.080 --> 01:20:31.860
Travis Rickford: They're your mom's.

939
01:20:32.690 --> 01:20:34.600
Shannon: At his mother, at his mother's.

940
01:20:34.600 --> 01:20:39.559
Travis Rickford: Okay, so your mother-in-law's, how is your relationship with

941
01:20:40.620 --> 01:20:43.830
Travis Rickford: his parents and your parents? What does that relationship look like.

942
01:20:45.610 --> 01:20:50.500
Shannon: Well, I mean, it's like it's it's good. I am.

943
01:20:51.250 --> 01:20:56.030
Shannon: Let's see, we both just have our moms and

944
01:20:57.740 --> 01:21:02.100
Shannon: you know, my mom lives here in Arizona, and I'm in Tennessee. So

945
01:21:02.480 --> 01:21:05.890
Shannon: that's kind of, you know, hard to build a good relationship

946
01:21:06.340 --> 01:21:11.470
Shannon: for them. For my husband and my mom, but you know I do pretty good.

947
01:21:12.192 --> 01:21:18.209
Shannon: No, with our relation. My relationship with my mother-in-law. She's she's a really good lady.

948
01:21:19.810 --> 01:21:21.549
Shannon: She's very helpful, too.

949
01:21:23.230 --> 01:21:25.540
Travis Rickford: And how often do you talk to your mom.

950
01:21:27.221 --> 01:21:32.520
Shannon: Well, I probably a few times a week, so.

951
01:21:33.870 --> 01:21:36.569
Travis Rickford: Is she someone that has helped you before

952
01:21:37.300 --> 01:21:40.300
Travis Rickford: with different things? Is she someone that you can talk to to

953
01:21:40.810 --> 01:21:43.590
Travis Rickford: about your future and and things that you want to do.

954
01:21:44.530 --> 01:21:46.269
Shannon: Yeah, yeah, I can definitely do that.

955
01:21:48.410 --> 01:21:49.180
Travis Rickford: Is

956
01:21:50.230 --> 01:21:58.080
Travis Rickford: talking with your your mom sort of a 1st step in making that plan, or is it contacting a therapist first.st

957
01:21:59.230 --> 01:22:03.629
Shannon: Oh, probably just would work for my mom.

958
01:22:05.550 --> 01:22:07.400
Shannon: As opposed to the therapist, because

959
01:22:07.800 --> 01:22:10.249
Shannon: it's been a while since I talked to

960
01:22:11.610 --> 01:22:15.100
Shannon: therapist or counselor. Well, I I did when I was in rehab

961
01:22:16.170 --> 01:22:21.300
Shannon: people I'm speaking of was like years ago, so ugh!

962
01:22:21.660 --> 01:22:23.509
Shannon: It'd be easier to talk with my mom.

963
01:22:24.750 --> 01:22:25.295
Travis Rickford: Well,

964
01:22:26.450 --> 01:22:31.850
Travis Rickford: A conversation with Mom. Sounds like where you're you're headed. Is that right?

965
01:22:32.660 --> 01:22:33.709
Kenneth Matthew Warner: Yeah, definitely.

966
01:22:34.190 --> 01:22:34.960
Travis Rickford: Okay.

967
01:22:35.070 --> 01:22:38.520
