36
00:03:03.911 --> 00:03:05.958
john bianculli: Part exciting, part nervous.

37
00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:10.260

40
00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:21.210
john bianculli: I have to go back to work. I'm going to a brand new office because they relocated while I was on my leave.

41
00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:27.329
john bianculli: So that's gonna be different, completely, new environment, computer workstation.

42
00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:32.320
john bianculli: That's gonna be different.

43
00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:37.149
Dolores Albarracin: Are. Are you in touch with your colleagues to see how

44
00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:40.600
Dolores Albarracin: that new space is working? Hello.

45
00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:45.900
john bianculli: Oh, yeah, I mean, everybody loves it. I mean, it's, you know, brain spanking new

46
00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:50.989
john bianculli: instead of having 3 smaller monitors. I have one large wraparound.

47
00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:51.810
Dolores Albarracin: Wow!

48
00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:53.130
john bianculli: It's a really nice setup.

49
00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:55.430
Dolores Albarracin: Very nice.

50
00:03:56.460 --> 00:04:01.820
john bianculli: And I. And one thing that some people didn't realize was I wasn't there.

51
00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:06.460
john bianculli: because apparently I had a few pieces of cake on my desk from birthday parties, but.

52
00:04:11.727 --> 00:04:12.902
Dolores Albarracin: That's funny.

53
00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:16.760
john bianculli: Hard to believe. People didn't realize I haven't been there for 2 months, but.

54
00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:17.279
Dolores Albarracin: Yeah.

55
00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:19.356
john bianculli: Oh, well.

56
00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:28.832
Petra Teeter 237121: Normally in an office. You can't keep your own food in the refrigerator without somebody stealing it.

57
00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:35.798
john bianculli: Well, me, I got the exact opposite problem. I got a bunch of food on my desk. Then I'm probably gonna need to dispose of.

58
00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:41.990
Dolores Albarracin: Alright! Welcome, everybody! Hello, Lou!

59
00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:43.430
Frank: Let's see.

60
00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:45.660
Dolores Albarracin: Today, the last meeting.

61
00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:46.530
Frank: Okay.

62
00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:58.099
Dolores Albarracin: of our set of 3 meetings. So I'm I'm really interested in in hearing 1st about everything that happened last week. I emailed with

63
00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:14.599
Dolores Albarracin: all of you to some extent, with some in in greater detail, and I know Fang is probably calling anybody who's not here yet to see if they can still make it and and help if and there are any zoom issues.

64
00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:21.939
Dolores Albarracin: So the 1st thing we want to do is, of course, just check how things went.

65
00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:29.049
Dolores Albarracin: So let me start with Lou. You were going to talk with your son about

66
00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:37.409
Dolores Albarracin: the Medicaid number, possibly getting help to locate that. How how did that go?

67
00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:45.359
Lewis: Oh, every everything went okay. I ended up getting in contact with a representative

68
00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:50.920
Lewis: from it after I called the 1 800 number through email, and it gave me their personal number and then

69
00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:58.812
Lewis: schedule for me to go see a doctor, and said that everything was was already situated that they would they'd be sending me a card, so.

70
00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:03.290
Dolores Albarracin: So complete success, when.

71
00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:06.209
Lewis: It's fairly easy.

72
00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:10.840
Dolores Albarracin: Yes. So when when is your doctor's appointment, Lou?

73
00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:13.630
Lewis: Next week, next week, Thursday.

74
00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:17.150
Dolores Albarracin: And this would be like a primary care person to.

75
00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:21.530
Lewis: Yeah, but just like Overall Checkup, because that's what I told him. I was most worried about.

76
00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:23.180
Lewis: Yep.

77
00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:32.400
Lewis: just to make sure that you know I didn't have any problems overall rather than targeting one area or one specific thing.

78
00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:40.230
Dolores Albarracin: Yeah. So I'm I'm curious what what happened this last week that

79
00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:47.170
Dolores Albarracin: made this a lot, you know, more doable for you. Figuring out this issue.

80
00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:49.599
Lewis: A lot of it, a lot of it.

81
00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:50.730
Dolores Albarracin: For a long time.

82
00:06:51.530 --> 00:06:53.959
Lewis: Yeah. Well, a lot of it is like I said, I end up.

83
00:06:54.130 --> 00:07:00.780
Lewis: I'm an over thinker. So I end up thinking about all my problems together, and rather than trying to solve certain ones or

84
00:07:00.810 --> 00:07:06.489
Lewis: focus on one important thing, then I end up, you know, feeling like I'm overwhelmed by everything.

85
00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:12.419
Lewis: So it was just to take the time to really put the research in. And you know, wasn't. Wasn't that hard at all?

86
00:07:13.650 --> 00:07:21.009
Dolores Albarracin: So so you think it's just prioritizing. Which one do I wanna fix this week.

87
00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:22.120
Lewis: Yeah.

88
00:07:22.530 --> 00:07:26.320
Dolores Albarracin: Can make it easier, more doable.

89
00:07:27.090 --> 00:07:33.539
Lewis: Yup. Then I got good news today that there's a a list, basically for the unhoused.

90
00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:39.399
Lewis: And they give you a 3 month like assistance, you know. They'll pay for 3 months of your rent.

91
00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:41.020
Lewis: or, you know, a deposit.

92
00:07:41.020 --> 00:07:42.660
Dolores Albarracin: That's amazing.

93
00:07:42.660 --> 00:07:48.559
Lewis: I've been on. I've been on the list for probably 6 months now, but one of the guys came to the

94
00:07:48.790 --> 00:08:07.000
Lewis: the the place that I stopped. You say, yeah, I need to talk with you. You got to sign some paperwork. He's like you have. We basically have 90 days. I'll assist you with finding a place. If you hear anything. If you see anything that's in your price range, just let me know, you know, advocate for you and basically explain how the program works to them to make sure that everything is okay.

95
00:08:08.030 --> 00:08:11.429
Dolores Albarracin: That's amazing. So how do you.

96
00:08:11.430 --> 00:08:13.180
Frank: Congratulations.

97
00:08:13.180 --> 00:08:14.510
Morgan Potts: That's awesome.

98
00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:19.380
Lewis: Yup, appreciate it definitely.

99
00:08:19.380 --> 00:08:25.220
Dolores Albarracin: Yes. So I mean, that's that's pretty incredible. So you persist

100
00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:36.479
Dolores Albarracin: with this for a long time to finally be bumped up. And and I guess. Yeah. So that's

101
00:08:37.199 --> 00:08:38.709
Dolores Albarracin: really great.

102
00:08:39.289 --> 00:08:53.159
Lewis: So from here. It's just, you know, setting setting everything to where I know it'll work out like having a job consistent and setting aside time to where I don't feel overwhelmed by the job, and trying to maintain regular life.

103
00:08:53.259 --> 00:08:54.099
Lewis: you know.

104
00:08:55.229 --> 00:09:04.469
Lewis: cause that that'll give me time at least, to like, you know, my, my whole thing is setting schedule for myself and doing things in a an orderly fashion throughout the day I end up doing the same things.

105
00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:05.150
Frank: Interesting.

106
00:09:05.470 --> 00:09:16.480
Lewis: You know. So it just works out that you know, I kind of changed up my program from what I'm doing now to including a job, and then from there having a place to live and maintaining that, and it should work out for me.

107
00:09:17.610 --> 00:09:18.560
Dolores Albarracin: So

108
00:09:18.810 --> 00:09:37.789
Dolores Albarracin: yeah, I want to talk more about the you know what's what's coming next. When, after seeing what everybody did. But I'm curious, did you share the good news? Both? Yeah on. You know the place and on the Medicaid issue with anybody.

109
00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:44.939
Lewis: Well, I told my brother about. You know the housing thing because he's been reaching out to me the most during this time.

110
00:09:45.290 --> 00:09:45.810
Lewis: so I

111
00:09:45.810 --> 00:09:57.110
Lewis: kind of just updated him was like, Yeah, you know, I made it to the top of the list. They had me sign the paperwork, so it's in effect, and I have to. I have to find something and get a job to maintain it. After that 3 months and stuff.

112
00:09:58.610 --> 00:09:58.990
Dolores Albarracin: No.

113
00:09:58.990 --> 00:10:04.839
Dolores Albarracin: What happens in in 3 months, then do they? Can they renew it, or or.

114
00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:15.019
Lewis: And that's that's the problem. They can't guarantee. They can renew it because they have so many people on the list, and they have to keep going down the list and try and help as many people as possible. So you have to use that time. So

115
00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:15.980
Lewis: it has.

116
00:10:16.910 --> 00:10:17.610
Lewis: I know.

117
00:10:17.610 --> 00:10:18.880
Dolores Albarracin: I'll continue.

118
00:10:19.390 --> 00:10:19.850
Lewis: Yeah.

119
00:10:20.233 --> 00:10:21.000
Frank: Yes. Hello.

120
00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:21.660
Dolores Albarracin: Was one day.

121
00:10:21.660 --> 00:10:23.270
Lewis: So I'm just staying positive.

122
00:10:23.270 --> 00:10:28.030
Dolores Albarracin: Was your brother excited, proud? What? What was his reaction?

123
00:10:28.330 --> 00:10:34.660
Lewis: Oh, no, he was. He was really happy because he knew that this this whole thing has been stressing me out and trying to find a solution to it. So

124
00:10:35.780 --> 00:10:41.260
Lewis: on his end, from being stressed out and not being able to help as much as he's able to.

125
00:10:41.690 --> 00:10:47.279
Lewis: you know, or want to. Then you know that that made him feel relieved on the other end. So

126
00:10:48.070 --> 00:10:49.595
Lewis: it's just happy for me overall.

127
00:10:50.430 --> 00:10:55.520
Frank: And telling me that I can. You know I can reach out to them if I need anything. Once everything gets situated.

128
00:10:57.350 --> 00:11:04.779
Dolores Albarracin: Really proud, just only changes you can make in in such a short period.

129
00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:07.339
Lewis: Yup, yup, definitely.

130
00:11:07.480 --> 00:11:09.340
Dolores Albarracin: Pretty, unbelievable.

131
00:11:09.537 --> 00:11:10.130
Lewis: So he needs.

132
00:11:10.130 --> 00:11:13.590
Dolores Albarracin: And to say for the group, others.

133
00:11:14.010 --> 00:11:18.659
Lewis: I'm just. I'm just really excited for you, man. I mean, I know that that

134
00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:30.879
Frank: Housing is top priority. And it can be really difficult to get into something. Anything. I mean, 3 months is huge. So that's that's amazing.

135
00:11:31.110 --> 00:11:32.170
Lewis: Appreciate it.

136
00:11:32.540 --> 00:11:35.500
Morgan Potts: Congratulations, Lou. I'm so happy for you.

137
00:11:35.730 --> 00:11:38.512
Lewis: Oh, thank you. I appreciate it.

138
00:11:40.250 --> 00:11:41.000
Lewis: Yep.

139
00:11:41.980 --> 00:11:48.370
Lewis: But overall it'll work out. There's, you know, stuff I gotta work out because of this is like, I gotta make sure everything else

140
00:11:48.400 --> 00:11:52.840
Lewis: falls into place like it's supposed to. So I got some work to do. But I'm positive about it.

141
00:11:54.150 --> 00:12:02.850
Dolores Albarracin: Wonderful. So I wanna ask, John how how things went you were looking into potentially

142
00:12:03.630 --> 00:12:12.070
Dolores Albarracin: get a new sponsor at least talking when when your California one about what's next? Yeah.

143
00:12:12.070 --> 00:12:12.570
john bianculli: Correct.

144
00:12:12.570 --> 00:12:13.350
Dolores Albarracin: Cisco.

145
00:12:13.750 --> 00:12:16.849
john bianculli: Yeah, that's what I mean. That's what I'm working on next. I

146
00:12:17.400 --> 00:12:22.729
john bianculli: they're kind of saying that the hotel is not the best place to be at.

147
00:12:23.890 --> 00:12:27.019
john bianculli: Yeah, they were trying to say they're trying to do sober living, but

148
00:12:27.510 --> 00:12:31.990
john bianculli: I mean my health insurance called me. They said they were going to try to find something. But

149
00:12:32.610 --> 00:12:35.410
john bianculli: I mean, unfortunately, the

150
00:12:35.460 --> 00:12:40.150
john bianculli: you have to be really careful with sober houses you get into. Some of them are really bad.

151
00:12:42.930 --> 00:12:44.370
Dolores Albarracin: How how so.

152
00:12:45.520 --> 00:12:52.360
john bianculli: Well, I mean, there are bad neighborhoods, people relapsing in the houses thinking here.

153
00:12:52.460 --> 00:12:56.230
john bianculli: I mean, the one house had a drug dealer right across the street from it.

154
00:12:57.490 --> 00:12:58.409
Morgan Potts: Oh, that's awesome!

155
00:12:58.410 --> 00:13:01.240
john bianculli: I mean, I'm trying not to be in those situations.

156
00:13:02.280 --> 00:13:03.210
Dolores Albarracin: Do you have any?

157
00:13:03.210 --> 00:13:06.249
john bianculli: And the ones in better neighborhoods. They're hard to locate.

158
00:13:07.610 --> 00:13:09.979
Dolores Albarracin: Do you have family, or, or.

159
00:13:10.290 --> 00:13:14.939
Dolores Albarracin: you know, long, long time friends in Pittsburgh or.

160
00:13:16.420 --> 00:13:18.510
john bianculli: Well, I mean, I do have family.

161
00:13:18.680 --> 00:13:23.470
john bianculli: I do have friends, but nobody with the spare couch, if that's what you mean.

162
00:13:25.900 --> 00:13:29.520
john bianculli: So yeah, so I mean the hotel. The hotel is about

163
00:13:29.710 --> 00:13:34.000
john bianculli: the only thing I could come up with at this point hopefully. Once I get to Pittsburgh.

164
00:13:34.140 --> 00:13:38.469
john bianculli: I'll be able to hit the pavement, maybe do a little better

165
00:13:39.390 --> 00:13:42.940
john bianculli: trying to do this remotely from California. It hasn't worked out well.

166
00:13:44.860 --> 00:13:47.740
Dolores Albarracin: How about a a convent of sorts?

167
00:13:49.730 --> 00:13:50.960
Dolores Albarracin: What do you mean?

168
00:13:51.390 --> 00:13:52.129
Dolores Albarracin: I mean some sort.

169
00:13:52.130 --> 00:13:52.820
john bianculli: Oh! Religious!

170
00:13:53.460 --> 00:13:54.290
Dolores Albarracin: Institution.

171
00:13:55.940 --> 00:13:57.765
john bianculli: Well, whenever I get home

172
00:13:59.118 --> 00:14:03.860
john bianculli: those are things I'm gonna have to look up. I mean, I know meetings in the area.

173
00:14:05.800 --> 00:14:09.359
john bianculli: But consider, I don't know exactly what I mean. I

174
00:14:09.900 --> 00:14:14.479
john bianculli: I'm not certain exactly what area I'm going to be in. So I mean, I kind of have a general idea.

175
00:14:14.490 --> 00:14:19.209
john bianculli: I know where the meetings are, the churches and all that. I kind of haven't solidified any of that yet.

176
00:14:20.330 --> 00:14:27.490
Dolores Albarracin: Perhaps one of the churches can connect you with somebody who maybe they want to rent

177
00:14:28.130 --> 00:14:35.880
Dolores Albarracin: part of their house, or or, you know, cottage or something temporarily.

178
00:14:35.880 --> 00:14:42.290
john bianculli: Yeah, David, yeah, I mean, the places I did check into their big hangup was the credit score.

179
00:14:43.620 --> 00:14:44.929
Dolores Albarracin: Is where sorry.

180
00:14:45.710 --> 00:14:51.549
Dolores Albarracin: So I mean the credit score. A lot of them wouldn't take you if you didn't have a score below 600.

181
00:14:53.650 --> 00:14:55.460
john bianculli: I mean the one with 6 50,

182
00:14:55.950 --> 00:15:01.020
john bianculli: which I thought was a bit ridiculous, expecting that they were on a list for people coming out of rehab.

183
00:15:01.500 --> 00:15:05.360
john bianculli: How many people coming out of Rehab have a 6 50 credit score? Not many.

184
00:15:05.420 --> 00:15:09.890
Frank: I know what you mean. That's that's not very practical.

185
00:15:09.890 --> 00:15:13.969
john bianculli: Yeah, I mean, the one organization actually took a couple of the people that I tried calling off the list.

186
00:15:13.970 --> 00:15:14.370
Frank: That's.

187
00:15:14.770 --> 00:15:18.979
john bianculli: Because, yeah, I I mean 6 50 credit score coming out of rehab isn't realistic.

188
00:15:19.880 --> 00:15:21.469
Frank: Access the door.

189
00:15:23.050 --> 00:15:29.490
Dolores Albarracin: So, for now it's you're going into the hotel and.

190
00:15:29.490 --> 00:15:30.070
john bianculli: Yeah.

191
00:15:30.070 --> 00:15:31.900
Dolores Albarracin: Figuring things out and.

192
00:15:34.210 --> 00:15:37.210
john bianculli: Yeah, I mean, I paid off one of my credit cards in a collection account.

193
00:15:37.370 --> 00:15:43.730
john bianculli: The problem, though, is that they expunged it from my credit report, which actually lowered my score instead of raising it.

194
00:15:43.730 --> 00:15:46.420
john bianculli: if they would have marked it as paid.

195
00:15:46.490 --> 00:15:51.469
john bianculli: it probably would help my score, but instead they expunged it, which then lowered my score.

196
00:15:51.980 --> 00:15:53.460
Dolores Albarracin: Can they fix it?

197
00:15:54.110 --> 00:15:56.570
john bianculli: I don't know. I'm gonna have to try to call them again.

198
00:15:57.630 --> 00:16:01.280
john bianculli: to try to put it back on as a paid collection rather than just taking it off.

199
00:16:03.800 --> 00:16:05.530
Dolores Albarracin: Okay. So

200
00:16:06.900 --> 00:16:20.310
Dolores Albarracin: you have at least a place a place to be in. And are you thinking of daily meetings, or or how are you gonna counter the possibility that the hotel might not be ideal. But you know that's.

201
00:16:20.310 --> 00:16:24.750
john bianculli: Well, I mean for the time being. I mean, I'm going to have to make it work. I don't have a choice.

202
00:16:24.750 --> 00:16:25.440
Dolores Albarracin: Yeah.

203
00:16:27.180 --> 00:16:29.220
john bianculli: But I mean one way to look at it.

204
00:16:29.810 --> 00:16:33.840
john bianculli: I mean, one way to look at it, though, is I'm not gonna have to worry about furniture utilities

205
00:16:33.950 --> 00:16:35.719
john bianculli: because they'll be in a hotel room.

206
00:16:36.010 --> 00:16:39.540
Dolores Albarracin: Exactly. Yes, yeah, that's very true.

207
00:16:40.070 --> 00:16:40.940
Dolores Albarracin: And.

208
00:16:40.940 --> 00:16:42.770
john bianculli: And I mean it's not that much.

209
00:16:42.860 --> 00:16:47.250
john bianculli: I mean it. It was actually less expensive than the rent I was paying.

210
00:16:48.050 --> 00:16:50.200
john bianculli: I mean, I was paying 1,600 a month.

211
00:16:50.600 --> 00:16:53.489
john bianculli: This place is gonna work out to a little over 1,200.

212
00:16:54.950 --> 00:16:57.660
Dolores Albarracin: So you'll save some money and and.

213
00:16:57.660 --> 00:17:00.720
john bianculli: A little bit. Yeah, compared to an apartment.

214
00:17:02.140 --> 00:17:02.960
Morgan Potts: Hey? Look at it

215
00:17:02.960 --> 00:17:07.100
Morgan Potts: way you got a maid that'll come in and make your bed every day. There's worse possible ways.

216
00:17:07.420 --> 00:17:08.475
john bianculli: Hey! There you go!

217
00:17:08.740 --> 00:17:10.010
Morgan Potts: We're saying.

218
00:17:10.569 --> 00:17:13.929
john bianculli: Yeah. Well, plus to the place has a kitchenette. It's a.

219
00:17:13.930 --> 00:17:14.359
Morgan Potts: Oh!

220
00:17:14.369 --> 00:17:15.379
john bianculli: And stay.

221
00:17:15.909 --> 00:17:19.499
john bianculli: I mean, those are actually pretty decent. I've I've stayed in them before.

222
00:17:22.579 --> 00:17:27.299
john bianculli: Yeah, I used to travel for a living, and I would spend a month down in Florida

223
00:17:27.339 --> 00:17:30.629
john bianculli: selling jewelry. So usually during that time period.

224
00:17:30.649 --> 00:17:34.569
john bianculli: Yeah, extended. Stay, you rent them by the month. That that's how I knew to.

225
00:17:34.609 --> 00:17:36.679
john bianculli: I found one in the Pittsburgh area.

226
00:17:39.500 --> 00:17:42.719
Dolores Albarracin: Excellent. So what's happening with the sponsor at Pittsburgh?

227
00:17:44.357 --> 00:17:47.219
john bianculli: Nothing as of yet. I mean.

228
00:17:47.550 --> 00:17:50.190
john bianculli: I'm gonna see them. Whenever I get back to Pittsburgh.

229
00:17:51.420 --> 00:17:59.010
john bianculli: I mean, there's hasn't been any communication in on my end or there. So yeah, I'm kind of surprised.

230
00:17:59.010 --> 00:17:59.530
Dolores Albarracin: Out there. Sure.

231
00:17:59.530 --> 00:18:01.489
john bianculli: Kind of let people disappear, but.

232
00:18:02.440 --> 00:18:06.319
Dolores Albarracin: Can you continue with the one in Florida, in in California?

233
00:18:06.877 --> 00:18:16.329
john bianculli: For a while. He's yeah. Yeah. I mean, because whenever he he kind of like the temporary concept, because he already had other people that he was

234
00:18:16.520 --> 00:18:17.730
john bianculli: sponsoring.

235
00:18:20.940 --> 00:18:26.000
Dolores Albarracin: Okay, when what does the group think of his current plan?

236
00:18:26.320 --> 00:18:32.180
Dolores Albarracin: How he's managing all of this ideas, thoughts.

237
00:18:33.950 --> 00:18:34.470
Morgan Potts: Well.

238
00:18:34.470 --> 00:18:37.500
Frank: That's what you got, dude. I'm sorry I didn't mean to interrupt you. I'm sorry.

239
00:18:37.500 --> 00:18:53.749
Frank: No, it's fine. I was just gonna say I I know how difficult it can be to to try to get into a place that's good for getting out of rehab, because a lot of those like sober houses like you said can be in really bad neighborhoods. They don't make it very easy for addicts to

240
00:18:54.190 --> 00:18:58.780
Frank: Unfortunately. So I think I think it's a good idea to stay in a

241
00:18:58.940 --> 00:19:03.505
Frank: a hotel as long as it's not one of those like grungy, like, you know.

242
00:19:04.500 --> 00:19:15.709
Frank: I stayed in one in in Vegas that was really just in a awful neighborhood. I think if it's a a decent hotel that you're staying in while you look for something else. I think it's a good idea.

243
00:19:17.960 --> 00:19:21.340
Dolores Albarracin: And you'll have work to keep you grounded right. I mean that.

244
00:19:21.340 --> 00:19:24.520
john bianculli: So, yeah, yeah, I mean, I like, I have

245
00:19:24.520 --> 00:19:26.309
john bianculli: be back to work that following Monday.

246
00:19:28.560 --> 00:19:32.530
Dolores Albarracin: And it's it's in banking. You said right.

247
00:19:32.530 --> 00:19:33.930
john bianculli: Yeah, yeah.

248
00:19:34.950 --> 00:19:37.349
Dolores Albarracin: Are you going back to exactly the same.

249
00:19:38.210 --> 00:19:40.310
john bianculli: Same schedule, same position.

250
00:19:41.840 --> 00:19:43.040
Dolores Albarracin: So other than.

251
00:19:43.040 --> 00:19:43.699
john bianculli: Same title.

252
00:19:43.700 --> 00:19:46.400
Dolores Albarracin: We knew all of that is familiar.

253
00:19:47.580 --> 00:19:51.290
john bianculli: Yeah, I mean, all of that's gonna be familiar. Just that the location changed

254
00:19:51.630 --> 00:19:55.350
john bianculli: and my computer changed like, literally, everything's brain spanking new.

255
00:19:58.780 --> 00:20:08.759
Dolores Albarracin: Alright. Well, it it seems like you're really continuing. Yeah, with all all the steps and and making the best of of everything so

256
00:20:09.280 --> 00:20:13.470
Dolores Albarracin: kudos to you for all of this. It's it's really wonderful.

257
00:20:13.900 --> 00:20:18.759
Dolores Albarracin: So yeah, yeah, did you want to say anything else? Anything else.

258
00:20:19.080 --> 00:20:26.460
john bianculli: Well, I mean, the job was what kind of kept me grounded that I I didn't lose my job. I might have lost my housing, but I didn't lose my job.

259
00:20:27.490 --> 00:20:29.200
Dolores Albarracin: Yes, I don't.

260
00:20:30.140 --> 00:20:30.810
john bianculli: No.

261
00:20:30.810 --> 00:20:35.059
Dolores Albarracin: What do you make of that like the job is is the

262
00:20:35.660 --> 00:20:39.649
Dolores Albarracin: really central thing for you, I guess. Yeah.

263
00:20:39.650 --> 00:20:43.220
john bianculli: Well, yeah, I mean, that's the other thing, too. I've worked there for 11 years.

264
00:20:43.590 --> 00:20:48.040
john bianculli: So I have a lot of a lot of my friends, our coworkers.

265
00:20:48.525 --> 00:20:49.000
Krystal: See.

266
00:20:51.220 --> 00:20:51.990
Dolores Albarracin: Are they support?

267
00:20:51.990 --> 00:20:52.440
john bianculli: I mean.

268
00:20:52.440 --> 00:20:56.139
Dolores Albarracin: Are they aware of what's going on? Not so much.

269
00:20:56.140 --> 00:21:00.060
john bianculli: 2 people, 2 people. Yes, everybody else knows.

270
00:21:00.610 --> 00:21:08.139
Dolores Albarracin: So so are you able to rely on on the 2 who know to at least

271
00:21:09.460 --> 00:21:13.380
Dolores Albarracin: spend more time or emotional support.

272
00:21:14.270 --> 00:21:17.439
john bianculli: I mean, probably partial support, not full.

273
00:21:18.010 --> 00:21:18.480
Krystal: Okay.

274
00:21:18.480 --> 00:21:24.259
john bianculli: But I mean at least I have something in place rather than nothing.

275
00:21:24.480 --> 00:21:30.529
Dolores Albarracin: Right? Yeah, yes, you're definitely

276
00:21:30.700 --> 00:21:36.269
Dolores Albarracin: among the very few fortunate enough to not have lost their job in the process.

277
00:21:39.510 --> 00:21:40.120
Krystal: So.

278
00:21:40.950 --> 00:21:42.110
Dolores Albarracin: That's really.

279
00:21:43.780 --> 00:21:44.479
john bianculli: You haven't.

280
00:21:44.480 --> 00:21:47.230
john bianculli: 4 day a week. Schedule is a blessing and a curse

281
00:21:47.690 --> 00:21:51.239
john bianculli: just due to the fact of the 4 day weekends. Whenever there's a holiday.

282
00:21:52.330 --> 00:21:56.030
john bianculli: You could definitely kind of get yourself into trouble and be sober by Monday, you know.

283
00:21:57.120 --> 00:22:01.849
Dolores Albarracin: Can you go? Can you go to the office during weekends, or or is it.

284
00:22:01.850 --> 00:22:04.200
john bianculli: Yeah, yeah, I can actually do overtime.

285
00:22:05.740 --> 00:22:10.020
john bianculli: So I mean, I learned every department. So I mean.

286
00:22:11.090 --> 00:22:13.970
john bianculli: I'm allowed to do up to 20 h of overtime, a week.

287
00:22:15.030 --> 00:22:16.070
Dolores Albarracin: I've owned every department

288
00:22:16.070 --> 00:22:25.290
Dolores Albarracin: just hanging out, hanging out in the office, even if you're not necessarily working yourself, you know, into the ground. But.

289
00:22:26.260 --> 00:22:30.929
john bianculli: Well, the new office. They have a Gym membership that you pay $75 a year for.

290
00:22:30.930 --> 00:22:31.510
Dolores Albarracin: Hmm.

291
00:22:31.510 --> 00:22:34.200
john bianculli: So the gym area you can hang out in.

292
00:22:35.200 --> 00:22:35.615
Krystal: But.

293
00:22:38.340 --> 00:22:41.970
Dolores Albarracin: That's great, and you're staying when you're

294
00:22:42.210 --> 00:22:47.290
Dolores Albarracin: healthy diet. And all this effort, yeah.

295
00:22:49.800 --> 00:22:51.389
john bianculli: Yeah. Still doing a walk every day.

296
00:22:56.120 --> 00:23:02.270
Dolores Albarracin: So something is happening with Crystal. So she's telling me that.

297
00:23:04.330 --> 00:23:07.010
john bianculli: She was unable to participate.

298
00:23:07.010 --> 00:23:08.740
Dolores Albarracin: Talk crystal.

299
00:23:16.490 --> 00:23:20.069
Dolores Albarracin: So it's okay. It's okay for us. If you cry.

300
00:23:20.070 --> 00:23:21.230
Krystal: Thank you.

301
00:23:30.430 --> 00:23:31.659
Dolores Albarracin: Did we lose her?

302
00:23:32.320 --> 00:23:33.400
Dolores Albarracin: I think so.

303
00:23:34.940 --> 00:23:43.120
Dolores Albarracin: Okay, so, pat, how did things go when you're exercise?

304
00:23:45.190 --> 00:23:46.420
Dolores Albarracin: You're muted.

305
00:23:52.840 --> 00:23:56.745
Patricia Renaud: There we go, going very well.

306
00:23:58.580 --> 00:24:06.969
Patricia Renaud: I was really motivated like Tuesday night, right after the meeting, so I jumped on the treadmill. I actually did.

307
00:24:06.970 --> 00:24:07.660
Dolores Albarracin: Fire!

308
00:24:08.630 --> 00:24:14.179
Patricia Renaud: Just a regular pace, you know. 30 min, and I did like a mile. So

309
00:24:15.150 --> 00:24:17.440
Patricia Renaud: I've been doing that every other day.

310
00:24:17.620 --> 00:24:25.519
Patricia Renaud: and I'm you know, walking outside in between those days. So keeping a journal.

311
00:24:26.420 --> 00:24:33.010
Patricia Renaud: My next plan is to eat better cutting down on salt

312
00:24:33.030 --> 00:24:36.530
Patricia Renaud: with the holidays. That's a real good motivator to.

313
00:24:36.770 --> 00:24:40.549
Patricia Renaud: you know. Watch what I eat and keep exercising, and

314
00:24:40.870 --> 00:24:50.139
Patricia Renaud: I put a picture of the grandkids on the treadmill, and that's my motivator. Every time I look at it, you know, that's what I'm working for. So it's going really. Well.

315
00:24:50.900 --> 00:24:53.530
Dolores Albarracin: How many times did you work out.

316
00:24:54.020 --> 00:24:56.049
Patricia Renaud: I do every other day.

317
00:24:56.240 --> 00:24:57.050
Dolores Albarracin: Wow!

318
00:24:57.230 --> 00:25:03.929
Dolores Albarracin: I'm not pushing it, you know, to do every day, and then it gets to the point where you'd get tired of it real fast, so

319
00:25:03.930 --> 00:25:07.179
Dolores Albarracin: pretty, I mean every other day is pretty amazing.

320
00:25:07.180 --> 00:25:07.800
Patricia Renaud: Yep.

321
00:25:07.800 --> 00:25:13.960
Dolores Albarracin: So how does it feel? When do you feel a sense of accomplishment? What what does it bring.

322
00:25:13.960 --> 00:25:16.805
Patricia Renaud: Yeah, I'm a sense of accomplishment.

323
00:25:18.520 --> 00:25:21.829
Patricia Renaud: I sleep better. I have more energy.

324
00:25:24.860 --> 00:25:26.929
Patricia Renaud: A lot of positive things.

325
00:25:28.140 --> 00:25:32.500
Patricia Renaud: I look forward to it. It's 1 thing I really look forward to. It.

326
00:25:32.890 --> 00:25:35.829
Dolores Albarracin: Wow! Are you doing it at night, or or.

327
00:25:35.830 --> 00:25:36.719
Patricia Renaud: Yeah,

328
00:25:38.740 --> 00:25:44.246
Patricia Renaud: Usually after work. I'm off for 2 weeks now for vacation. So

329
00:25:44.670 --> 00:25:47.640
Dolores Albarracin: Very nice, so you'll do more, more.

330
00:25:47.640 --> 00:25:48.340
Patricia Renaud: Yeah.

331
00:25:48.440 --> 00:25:53.670
Patricia Renaud: Yep. I want to work up to maybe like a mile and a half on that time off.

332
00:25:53.780 --> 00:25:58.160
Patricia Renaud: And then, after that, gradually, you know, work my way up to

333
00:25:58.370 --> 00:26:02.009
Patricia Renaud: 2, 3 miles, if that's you know, feasible.

334
00:26:02.310 --> 00:26:04.367
Patricia Renaud: which I'm sure it will be

335
00:26:04.710 --> 00:26:23.339
Dolores Albarracin: Yeah, we'll we'll come back to to this. I wanna 1st review everything we talked about last week. So did you share this with anybody that you had started to work out the process or anything? And- and were they? What was their reaction.

336
00:26:23.780 --> 00:26:27.829
Patricia Renaud: I got my fiance on board actually, too. You know.

337
00:26:27.930 --> 00:26:34.909
Patricia Renaud: he's diabetic. So he wants to eat better and start exercising, so we can hold each other accountable.

338
00:26:35.060 --> 00:26:36.620
Patricia Renaud: which is nice.

339
00:26:37.170 --> 00:26:42.910
Patricia Renaud: I think that'll be more successful. That you have a partner that you can, you know.

340
00:26:43.010 --> 00:26:47.579
Patricia Renaud: rely on. If there's a bad day, and they could pick you up.

341
00:26:47.680 --> 00:26:48.520
Patricia Renaud: Basically.

342
00:26:48.520 --> 00:26:51.859
Dolores Albarracin: Your success actually motivated him.

343
00:26:52.460 --> 00:26:53.170
Patricia Renaud: Yeah.

344
00:26:53.420 --> 00:26:54.290
Dolores Albarracin: As well.

345
00:26:55.190 --> 00:26:57.140
Dolores Albarracin: Do you tell anybody else.

346
00:26:58.240 --> 00:27:00.160
Patricia Renaud: Friends at work.

347
00:27:00.600 --> 00:27:06.439
Patricia Renaud: Hopefully. I'm motivating them as well, you know, just trying to help everybody stay healthier.

348
00:27:06.440 --> 00:27:08.370
Dolores Albarracin: Yeah, a role model.

349
00:27:08.630 --> 00:27:09.240
Patricia Renaud: Yeah.

350
00:27:09.650 --> 00:27:10.610
Dolores Albarracin: For others.

351
00:27:11.970 --> 00:27:13.410
Dolores Albarracin: That's wonderful.

352
00:27:13.700 --> 00:27:14.760
Patricia Renaud: Thank you.

353
00:27:16.660 --> 00:27:19.489
Dolores Albarracin: And it's right. I don't.

354
00:27:19.490 --> 00:27:20.950
Dolores Albarracin: Yeah, that's something good.

355
00:27:20.950 --> 00:27:24.580
Dolores Albarracin: That's right. You didn't have anything. It always seems.

356
00:27:24.580 --> 00:27:27.998
Petra Teeter 237121: Oh, no, no, no! I have stuff. Don't get me.

357
00:27:28.340 --> 00:27:30.789
Dolores Albarracin: You don't bring it up here.

358
00:27:31.840 --> 00:27:36.130
Petra Teeter 237121: Yeah, I've been dealing with this for like 16, almost 18.

359
00:27:36.530 --> 00:27:38.059
Patricia Renaud: 16 to 18 years.

360
00:27:39.220 --> 00:27:39.900
Dolores Albarracin: The pain.

361
00:27:39.900 --> 00:27:45.779
Petra Teeter 237121: I try. Yeah, I try not to accept it, but it is has become part of my life.

362
00:27:45.990 --> 00:27:47.789
Petra Teeter 237121: I just have to deal with it.

363
00:27:48.120 --> 00:27:54.340
Petra Teeter 237121: I will occasionally, when I have an idea like this group, I'm getting to it.

364
00:27:54.530 --> 00:27:57.899
Petra Teeter 237121: So you all gave me this idea of this.

365
00:27:58.180 --> 00:28:02.600
Petra Teeter 237121: So here's my problem with my pain. It's if I could just

366
00:28:02.840 --> 00:28:06.749
Petra Teeter 237121: constantly keep moving and never stop

367
00:28:06.780 --> 00:28:14.830
Petra Teeter 237121: doesn't have to be running. I'm just saying like a fast walk or something. Then my pain

368
00:28:15.200 --> 00:28:16.830
Petra Teeter 237121: level goes down.

369
00:28:18.640 --> 00:28:23.881
Petra Teeter 237121: It just did so that's what I'm standing on.

370
00:28:24.230 --> 00:28:29.899
Dolores Albarracin: And the pain. The pain is where again.

371
00:28:31.520 --> 00:28:32.150
Petra Teeter 237121: It.

372
00:28:32.560 --> 00:28:35.470
Petra Teeter 237121: It is mainly the back and going

373
00:28:35.970 --> 00:28:41.309
Petra Teeter 237121: specifically into both hips and down. We're, you know, we're in the legs.

374
00:28:41.310 --> 00:28:43.260
Dolores Albarracin: Chaotic type, thing.

375
00:28:43.260 --> 00:28:46.000
Petra Teeter 237121: Yeah. But it's yeah.

376
00:28:46.080 --> 00:28:54.729
Petra Teeter 237121: It's it's that area exactly. Often, it just starts really bad here, gives me all sorts of health issues.

377
00:28:55.850 --> 00:28:56.580
Petra Teeter 237121: That.

378
00:28:56.580 --> 00:28:57.779
Patricia Renaud: Have you ever tried.

379
00:28:58.376 --> 00:28:59.569
Petra Teeter 237121: What's that?

380
00:28:59.570 --> 00:29:02.089
Patricia Renaud: I'm sorry. Have you ever tried chiropractic.

381
00:29:02.530 --> 00:29:05.149
Petra Teeter 237121: Yes, did it. I

382
00:29:05.810 --> 00:29:13.289
Petra Teeter 237121: I mean, I don't want to say I've tried it all. But you all, if you have an idea, bring it up because I'm open. I have tried it.

383
00:29:13.850 --> 00:29:20.639
Petra Teeter 237121: There's nothing wrong with it. I think it's a great idea, and I've seen it help my husband for other issues.

384
00:29:20.670 --> 00:29:28.710
Petra Teeter 237121: but it doesn't help me with mine. So I bought this little elliptical, I think Morgan brought it up for Patricia, one of you.

385
00:29:28.810 --> 00:29:35.689
Petra Teeter 237121: and I saw it on one of those super deals. And I thought, Okay, this is it. That's what I'm on.

386
00:29:35.780 --> 00:29:38.510
Petra Teeter 237121: And it took a little bit of

387
00:29:39.430 --> 00:29:45.579
Petra Teeter 237121: just getting used to it. I had to pay attention because most of them are made for somebody who sits

388
00:29:46.270 --> 00:29:50.379
Petra Teeter 237121: and and just move their legs. I needed one for my standing desk.

389
00:29:50.800 --> 00:29:54.289
Petra Teeter 237121: So I'm actually standing. And I can go, you know.

390
00:29:54.560 --> 00:29:58.309
Petra Teeter 237121: get some exercise in, or I can just wiggle is what I call it.

391
00:29:58.700 --> 00:30:00.560
Petra Teeter 237121: And so that helps me

392
00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:04.919
Petra Teeter 237121: It was so funny. It arrived.

393
00:30:05.220 --> 00:30:17.369
Petra Teeter 237121: and my younger son came home, and he was instantly. Oh, my God, mom, you've got something new going on. He dropped everything. Just put it together. I was like, There you go.

394
00:30:18.340 --> 00:30:19.090
Petra Teeter 237121: Oh, okay.

395
00:30:19.090 --> 00:30:22.090
Dolores Albarracin: So was it. Was it at all helpful.

396
00:30:22.440 --> 00:30:31.320
Petra Teeter 237121: Yeah, it's a little bit. I'm not saying I don't have pain, and I still have to go. Lay down and sleep with that pain. But it's

397
00:30:31.380 --> 00:30:36.769
Petra Teeter 237121: I do 75% of my work on the computer.

398
00:30:36.860 --> 00:30:39.060
Petra Teeter 237121: And it had gotten really hard.

399
00:30:39.100 --> 00:30:41.989
Petra Teeter 237121: And it's just like, I can't really

400
00:30:42.030 --> 00:30:50.200
Petra Teeter 237121: show that I'm in pain, and I have got it. And it's also it's affecting my brain because it it's just focused on the pain and not

401
00:30:50.260 --> 00:30:51.849
Petra Teeter 237121: what I need to think of.

402
00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:55.570
Petra Teeter 237121: And so it's it just helps a little bit.

403
00:30:56.130 --> 00:30:56.509
Dolores Albarracin: I don't know.

404
00:30:56.510 --> 00:31:01.548
Petra Teeter 237121: And I'm and I have to get used to it still, because it's you know it's a little wiggly and

405
00:31:02.130 --> 00:31:08.470
Petra Teeter 237121: but it, you know every little bit. If if I can find 20 things that all help a little bit.

406
00:31:08.800 --> 00:31:11.890
Petra Teeter 237121: it'll come 2 big one in. It

407
00:31:12.580 --> 00:31:15.699
Petra Teeter 237121: may not fix itself, but if I can control it

408
00:31:16.150 --> 00:31:20.179
Petra Teeter 237121: makes me happy. So small step I take any small step.

409
00:31:20.180 --> 00:31:24.229
Dolores Albarracin: And do you have like this problems or.

410
00:31:24.230 --> 00:31:24.960
Petra Teeter 237121: No.

411
00:31:24.960 --> 00:31:25.810
Dolores Albarracin: Or 3 digits.

412
00:31:26.160 --> 00:31:27.030
Dolores Albarracin: It's not.

413
00:31:27.030 --> 00:31:29.670
Petra Teeter 237121: Medical. That's just it, I know.

414
00:31:30.620 --> 00:31:31.380
Petra Teeter 237121: Yep.

415
00:31:31.860 --> 00:31:32.520
Dolores Albarracin: Well, then.

416
00:31:32.520 --> 00:31:37.589
Petra Teeter 237121: Pain. Medication doesn't help. It just turns me into a vegetable, and I don't even know where I am.

417
00:31:38.600 --> 00:31:40.580
Petra Teeter 237121: and I still feel the pain so.

418
00:31:40.580 --> 00:31:46.769
Dolores Albarracin: It seems like exercise is the way, yeah. And and do you want to lose weight, too, or no?

419
00:31:47.220 --> 00:31:48.909
Petra Teeter 237121: Oh, yes, please.

420
00:31:48.990 --> 00:31:56.309
Petra Teeter 237121: I have always exercised a lot, I think, since I was maybe 11 years old I was a big big runner.

421
00:31:57.009 --> 00:32:03.970
Petra Teeter 237121: and then with the pain it just really like taking that away from me is is was

422
00:32:04.240 --> 00:32:05.850
Petra Teeter 237121: a big part of my life.

423
00:32:05.850 --> 00:32:06.200
Dolores Albarracin: Okay.

424
00:32:07.550 --> 00:32:11.170
Dolores Albarracin: Elliptical idea, then, was really, really good.

425
00:32:11.170 --> 00:32:13.812
Petra Teeter 237121: Yeah, kind of fit with. Yes.

426
00:32:14.400 --> 00:32:17.180
Petra Teeter 237121: So thank you. To this group.

427
00:32:18.110 --> 00:32:18.980
Dolores Albarracin: Well, thanks.

428
00:32:18.980 --> 00:32:20.690
Petra Teeter 237121: Things have little things, matter.

429
00:32:21.285 --> 00:32:21.880
Dolores Albarracin: Yeah.

430
00:32:23.360 --> 00:32:32.510
Dolores Albarracin: Yeah. So Morgan was another group member who wanted to go to the gym and work. How was that.

431
00:32:32.710 --> 00:32:33.909
Morgan Potts: I went.

432
00:32:34.520 --> 00:32:40.320
Morgan Potts: I drug myself in there. I didn't stay very, very long. I did about 20 min, but you know.

433
00:32:40.626 --> 00:32:41.239
Dolores Albarracin: Thank you.

434
00:32:41.720 --> 00:32:42.930
Morgan Potts: It's better than 0.

435
00:32:43.750 --> 00:32:50.669
Dolores Albarracin: Yes, yeah. The plan was 10 min, I think, or something. Really. Yeah. Low key. Initially.

436
00:32:51.050 --> 00:32:51.860
Morgan Potts: Yes, ma'am.

437
00:32:51.860 --> 00:32:54.769
Dolores Albarracin: So did you go one time, right after work.

438
00:32:56.122 --> 00:33:00.525
Morgan Potts: Yeah, I went Monday, after work and

439
00:33:02.250 --> 00:33:10.059
Morgan Potts: it was. It was okay. It wasn't exactly enjoyable. But you know, like we said once, you just get in there, you do feel better. So

440
00:33:10.820 --> 00:33:14.769
Morgan Potts: After the holidays are over with. Hopefully, I can

441
00:33:14.880 --> 00:33:17.940
Morgan Potts: increase a little bit more. Just

442
00:33:17.960 --> 00:33:22.919
Morgan Potts: kind of right now. It's not exactly terribly motivating. I'm sure you can all can understand that.

443
00:33:24.800 --> 00:33:27.949
Dolores Albarracin: Yeah, that's how I feel about exercise. Typically.

444
00:33:29.270 --> 00:33:35.492
Petra Teeter 237121: I am the only one in here who actually wants or likes it and is camp. The kills her.

445
00:33:37.215 --> 00:33:37.520
Lewis: Yeah.

446
00:33:37.520 --> 00:33:38.219
Dolores Albarracin: Another, one.

447
00:33:38.220 --> 00:33:42.289
Lewis: I I do ride a bike everywhere I go. I don't have a license, so I'm right there.

448
00:33:42.290 --> 00:33:48.259
Petra Teeter 237121: There you go! Good for you! That's your that's your German lifestyle. I like it. I wished I could.

449
00:33:48.260 --> 00:33:49.527
Dolores Albarracin: Good for you.

450
00:33:51.130 --> 00:33:54.030
Dolores Albarracin: Morgan is back.

451
00:33:55.390 --> 00:33:57.710
Dolores Albarracin: So Morgan.

452
00:33:57.940 --> 00:33:59.940
Morgan Potts: Sorry about that. I don't know what happened.

453
00:34:00.220 --> 00:34:03.799
Dolores Albarracin: Yeah, well, you're probably, you know you're driving. So the connection.

454
00:34:03.800 --> 00:34:04.570
Morgan Potts: Sorry.

455
00:34:04.570 --> 00:34:06.190
Dolores Albarracin: Not be so great. But

456
00:34:06.580 --> 00:34:12.709
Dolores Albarracin: tell me, you said well, it wasn't enjoyable. I mean what? What was the worst part.

457
00:34:12.719 --> 00:34:26.199
Morgan Potts: Well, I did the dragging myself in. There was the worst part, but you know, after I was done with, I felt better. I really did I? Just you know it's dark. It's been a long day. It's Monday, too. You just want to go home. But I did it.

458
00:34:26.289 --> 00:34:29.179
Morgan Potts: and I did feel better about myself after it, so

459
00:34:30.279 --> 00:34:32.059
Morgan Potts: so I'm glad that I went.

460
00:34:32.320 --> 00:34:35.870
Dolores Albarracin: Did you share with anybody that you had done this.

461
00:34:37.690 --> 00:34:39.170
Morgan Potts: I mentioned it to my mom.

462
00:34:39.380 --> 00:34:39.960
Dolores Albarracin: You know.

463
00:34:39.960 --> 00:34:44.390
Morgan Potts: And of course, and of course you know your mom being your mom, I mean

464
00:34:44.449 --> 00:34:50.270
Morgan Potts: honey, like I could have won the Pulitzer prize, and it would have been like equally the same thing. So

465
00:34:50.380 --> 00:34:52.140
Morgan Potts: she was very glad that I went.

466
00:34:55.770 --> 00:34:56.960
Dolores Albarracin: Excellent.

467
00:34:57.790 --> 00:35:00.160
Dolores Albarracin: Well, yeah, a lot of successes.

468
00:35:00.310 --> 00:35:01.310
Dolores Albarracin: Yes, ma'am.

469
00:35:03.130 --> 00:35:04.290
Dolores Albarracin: How was your week?

470
00:35:05.323 --> 00:35:23.490
Frank: It was okay I had quite a few appointments and things, and but I guess the biggest thing that I've been dealing with is my one of my dogs is sick to the point where you know, talking

471
00:35:23.860 --> 00:35:28.760
Frank: about putting them down fairly soon. So that's

472
00:35:30.970 --> 00:35:36.579
Frank: upsetting. So I've I've been trying to, you know, kind of spend as much time as possible with him and

473
00:35:38.510 --> 00:35:39.150
Frank: Yeah.

474
00:35:41.260 --> 00:35:43.640
Dolores Albarracin: Is he your only pet.

475
00:35:44.280 --> 00:36:02.360
Frank: No, I have 2 dogs, and and it's kind of a bummer, too, because, the they're 2 dogs and they're they're like best friends. You know what I mean. They they sleep in the kennel together, and they're they're always together. They've been together since, you know, 1 6 months old. So

476
00:36:03.600 --> 00:36:06.989
Frank: It's going to be a loss for the other dog, too.

477
00:36:09.360 --> 00:36:11.530
Dolores Albarracin: Well, that sounds pretty terrible.

478
00:36:12.320 --> 00:36:19.400
Dolores Albarracin: Who who is able to support you or give you some comfort.

479
00:36:20.523 --> 00:36:32.540
Frank: I I mean my my partner, you know. She's gonna be aching as much, too, you know, from from the loss of. my grandma knows how much I you know

480
00:36:33.880 --> 00:36:46.022
Frank: love my pets and you know she'd be there, and I have, you know, some some other friends that know. You know everybody knows that I love my pets. It's not a secret, so

481
00:36:46.470 --> 00:36:48.560
Frank: You know I do have

482
00:36:48.580 --> 00:36:54.017
Frank: some support. My sponsor as well. You know he's a big animal guy himself. So

483
00:36:55.830 --> 00:37:02.047
Frank: he understands, too. And they all kinda know that I'm

484
00:37:03.130 --> 00:37:13.480
Frank: going through this right now, because we just got some blood work back from him this past week. So

485
00:37:13.680 --> 00:37:15.610
Frank: it's just not looking very good.

486
00:37:18.110 --> 00:37:18.440
Dolores Albarracin: Well.

487
00:37:18.440 --> 00:37:22.249
john bianculli: Well, one thing you may want to try to do is cherish all the time you have with her.

488
00:37:22.590 --> 00:37:25.340
Morgan Potts: Maybe try to pamper, cook her a meal.

489
00:37:25.710 --> 00:37:28.440
john bianculli: Just try to treat her the best you can, so that

490
00:37:29.050 --> 00:37:33.959
john bianculli: at least the 2 of you have good memories from for the time that you do have with her.

491
00:37:34.500 --> 00:37:38.146
Frank: Yeah, yeah, I mean, I'm I'm already having to kind of

492
00:37:38.610 --> 00:37:42.409
Frank: cook his food for him because

493
00:37:42.590 --> 00:37:57.790
Frank: he's not eating dog food anymore. So, but you know I give him treats as much as he'll eat them, and as much snuggling. He's not really a snuggler, but I try so, but just kind of doing everything that he wants to do.

494
00:38:00.440 --> 00:38:07.779
Dolores Albarracin: And in the last week was your plan to try to exercise with Lisa.

495
00:38:07.780 --> 00:38:11.232
Frank: Oh, no! It was to do the the pt

496
00:38:13.620 --> 00:38:14.840
Dolores Albarracin: Yes, yes, yes.

497
00:38:15.340 --> 00:38:16.770
Dolores Albarracin: Exercises. Yeah.

498
00:38:16.770 --> 00:38:20.596
Frank: It didn't happen. I'm I'm not gonna sit here and say that it did

499
00:38:20.870 --> 00:38:21.899
Dolores Albarracin: Of course. Yes.

500
00:38:21.960 --> 00:38:26.699
Frank: I've just been kind of a a wreck. I haven't really

501
00:38:27.550 --> 00:38:31.659
Frank: wanted to do a whole lot of physical. Usually when I get like a a

502
00:38:31.900 --> 00:38:38.339
Frank: down or depressed. I don't really want to be physical, even though I know that being physical can can

503
00:38:38.340 --> 00:38:43.900
Frank: make you feel better. It's just. I know that intellectually I just can't put it into practice.

504
00:38:45.750 --> 00:38:47.409
Dolores Albarracin: So I guess what.

505
00:38:47.780 --> 00:38:50.399
Frank: What you want is now.

506
00:38:50.890 --> 00:38:56.699
Dolores Albarracin: Not the Pt. But something that allows you to feel better emotionally.

507
00:38:57.890 --> 00:38:58.380
Frank: Yeah.

508
00:38:58.380 --> 00:39:02.600
Dolores Albarracin: Maybe making peace with, you know, and it

509
00:39:03.010 --> 00:39:06.410
Dolores Albarracin: dog being at this this stage.

510
00:39:07.430 --> 00:39:12.915
Frank: Yeah, I know there's I mean there's support groups for everything, you know. So

511
00:39:14.880 --> 00:39:16.659
Frank: You know, when I

512
00:39:16.980 --> 00:39:24.699
Frank: I've dealt with plenty of grief in my life and and found grief support groups to be helpful.

513
00:39:26.700 --> 00:39:30.710
Frank: I haven't looked into any for loss of a pet, but I'm sure they're out there.

514
00:39:32.300 --> 00:39:36.700
Dolores Albarracin: Do you think this this is something that's going to

515
00:39:37.210 --> 00:39:41.889
Dolores Albarracin: be prolonged, or or or sort of a matter of days, or.

516
00:39:43.540 --> 00:39:47.700
Frank: I'm not sure honestly. I just

517
00:39:48.220 --> 00:39:53.103
Frank: I get you know my my pets are like family and

518
00:39:54.290 --> 00:39:55.520
Morgan Potts: So.

519
00:39:55.760 --> 00:40:00.130
Frank: It's not just gonna be a couple of days. It it!

520
00:40:00.230 --> 00:40:05.785
Frank: That'll be longer than that. I just I don't know. I don't know how long it's I can't

521
00:40:06.310 --> 00:40:10.990
Frank: know that, really. But it! It won't just be a couple of days, for sure.

522
00:40:11.360 --> 00:40:19.350
Dolores Albarracin: Not the whole process of of grief. Yeah. But but you know the this actual acute situation. Yeah. And what.

523
00:40:19.350 --> 00:40:19.900
Frank: Oh!

524
00:40:20.300 --> 00:40:21.260
Dolores Albarracin: To decide.

525
00:40:21.260 --> 00:40:26.380
Frank: I mean, I know that the last last dog that I had that passed. I

526
00:40:26.510 --> 00:40:30.500
Frank: didn't really even leave the bed for a week. So I

527
00:40:30.530 --> 00:40:33.879
Frank: I don't know if it's gonna follow along those lines, or or what.

528
00:40:35.540 --> 00:40:38.959
john bianculli: Are you gonna let nature take its course, or are you gonna

529
00:40:39.370 --> 00:40:43.580
john bianculli: have her put to sleep? Which way did you think of which

530
00:40:43.720 --> 00:40:45.609
john bianculli: direction. You want to go on that.

531
00:40:46.100 --> 00:41:00.910
Frank: Yeah, I mean, I don't. I don't want him to be in a lot of pain. So if he, you know, gets to the point where he's not eating, or if he's not able to walk or you know, if I just see that he's just really miserable, then I'm we're gonna put him down.

532
00:41:03.580 --> 00:41:04.460
Frank: That's correct.

533
00:41:05.010 --> 00:41:09.730
Morgan Potts: I'm so sorry to hear that, Brent. You got a lot going on recently, and

534
00:41:10.510 --> 00:41:16.779
Morgan Potts: I've had to do the same thing with my fuzzy best friend, so I'll be thinking about you over the holidays. Dude.

535
00:41:17.930 --> 00:41:25.289
john bianculli: Yeah, me, too. As well. Sorry to hear sorry to hear that you're going through that in the holidays. I mean, any time of the year is bad, but

536
00:41:25.450 --> 00:41:29.229
john bianculli: having to happen during the holiday season, it makes it more rough.

537
00:41:30.800 --> 00:41:31.769
Frank: Appreciate it.

538
00:41:32.520 --> 00:41:39.450
Lewis: Yeah, I was. I was, gonna say, I was away at school when the dog that I basically known since I was 10,

539
00:41:39.850 --> 00:41:47.059
Lewis: went through. You know his situation to where my dad had to make the decision. So I was kind of upset that I wasn't even notified.

540
00:41:47.080 --> 00:41:51.170
Lewis: So being able to have that that time to, you know, cherish what

541
00:41:51.180 --> 00:41:56.550
Lewis: you know. Your friendship and everything that you guys have been through is, you know, the best thing that you can get out of it.

542
00:41:56.650 --> 00:41:59.129
Lewis: and just try and keep that with you as much as possible.

543
00:41:59.670 --> 00:42:00.870
Frank: Sure. Yeah.

544
00:42:01.900 --> 00:42:08.412
Dolores Albarracin: Are there family members or friends who could do a little bit of caretaking for you?

545
00:42:09.080 --> 00:42:10.160
john bianculli: It's done.

546
00:42:11.170 --> 00:42:12.030
Frank: So.

547
00:42:12.030 --> 00:42:14.749
Dolores Albarracin: For your partner, too. It seems like he's all.

548
00:42:17.040 --> 00:42:19.619
Frank: Yeah, I I think that.

549
00:42:21.339 --> 00:42:25.459
Frank: I don't really have a lot of like local friends, so I don't know about.

550
00:42:25.460 --> 00:42:27.573
john bianculli: That's probably.

551
00:42:28.630 --> 00:42:33.057
Frank: People being able to like come over and do anything but

552
00:42:33.800 --> 00:42:35.730
john bianculli: I think just.

553
00:42:36.380 --> 00:42:37.460
Frank: Inviting me.

554
00:42:37.920 --> 00:42:38.730
john bianculli: No, I don't.

555
00:42:38.730 --> 00:42:39.060
Frank: I don't know.

556
00:42:39.060 --> 00:42:41.510
john bianculli: You know, they're just.

557
00:42:41.510 --> 00:42:42.420
Frank: Caller.

558
00:42:42.420 --> 00:42:43.019
john bianculli: You know what.

559
00:42:43.020 --> 00:42:45.139
Frank: Reaching out by text.

560
00:42:46.150 --> 00:42:49.000
Frank: It's just showing they're thinking of me helps enough, you know.

561
00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:50.999
john bianculli: It's all packed up for it for you later.

562
00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:52.350
Lewis: To have people like that.

563
00:42:57.070 --> 00:42:58.150
john bianculli: Hearing, some

564
00:42:59.800 --> 00:43:03.300
Dolores Albarracin: In a conversation in the background, but I don't know where it's coming.

565
00:43:03.300 --> 00:43:06.779
john bianculli: Apologize. Some of my housemates are men in the room.

566
00:43:06.780 --> 00:43:11.200
Dolores Albarracin: Okay, okay, just yeah. Just mute yourself. For a love. It.

567
00:43:11.200 --> 00:43:11.910
john bianculli: Okay.

568
00:43:11.910 --> 00:43:13.750
Dolores Albarracin: They are around so we can.

569
00:43:14.100 --> 00:43:14.900
john bianculli: Okay.

570
00:43:15.710 --> 00:43:25.769
Dolores Albarracin: Yeah, so well. The next question, which is difficult for you, France specifically is, is, Well, what's

571
00:43:27.390 --> 00:43:37.500
Dolores Albarracin: what's our future for the next 2 or 3 months. So no, not a very long term future, but sort of preparing for for what's coming, and

572
00:43:37.690 --> 00:43:44.820
Dolores Albarracin: also thinking, how connected do we want to stay with this group, since we're not gonna be having

573
00:43:45.130 --> 00:43:50.699
Dolores Albarracin: having these formal meetings. But it doesn't mean you cannot Zoom Meetings if you want.

574
00:43:50.700 --> 00:43:51.380
Dolores Albarracin: Hmm!

575
00:43:51.890 --> 00:43:52.660
Frank: Sure.

576
00:43:53.430 --> 00:43:59.150
Dolores Albarracin: So yeah, maybe maybe you can speculate. You know

577
00:43:59.990 --> 00:44:02.359
Dolores Albarracin: what you might want to see.

578
00:44:03.180 --> 00:44:03.910
Frank: I mean.

579
00:44:03.910 --> 00:44:07.549
john bianculli: We want to maybe try to pick a like, maybe a Saturday.

580
00:44:08.130 --> 00:44:10.829
john bianculli: because most people, you know, have to work during the week

581
00:44:11.640 --> 00:44:15.430
john bianculli: and maybe doing them occasionally. Groups on the weekends

582
00:44:15.800 --> 00:44:18.170
john bianculli: might not be such a bad idea. We have the app

583
00:44:18.500 --> 00:44:21.670
john bianculli: that we can still keep connected through.

584
00:44:24.280 --> 00:44:30.170
Dolores Albarracin: Absolutely, and we could definitely help with

585
00:44:32.070 --> 00:44:37.230
Dolores Albarracin: the meetings on on the schedule for you. So then you have no time. Limitation.

586
00:44:37.230 --> 00:44:40.490
john bianculli: You work today. So funny, we can do.

587
00:44:40.490 --> 00:44:41.220
Dolores Albarracin: But

588
00:44:41.740 --> 00:44:47.799
Dolores Albarracin: because for you, Frank, in the next 2 or 3 months, what would you like to see for you.

589
00:44:48.440 --> 00:44:54.859
Dolores Albarracin: you know, wouldn't, wouldn't feeling better mood, wise, be sort of top priority.

590
00:44:55.920 --> 00:44:58.431
Frank: Yeah, I I think that

591
00:45:00.920 --> 00:45:03.190
Frank: You know if- if

592
00:45:03.670 --> 00:45:09.030
Frank: you know he does wind up if I do wind up losing him. You know, in that

593
00:45:09.270 --> 00:45:14.290
Frank: period of time that yeah, just being able to kind of

594
00:45:14.640 --> 00:45:21.869
Frank: work through the grief is going to be a top priority. But if not, you know, just being able to spend.

595
00:45:22.600 --> 00:45:31.569
Frank: you know, quality time with him. And it's gonna be important for me. With this group, though I think that

596
00:45:32.130 --> 00:45:35.770
Frank: the online platform. I haven't been as active on it this

597
00:45:36.180 --> 00:45:42.260
Frank: past week because I would have liked to. But I think that that's a good way for us to interact and

598
00:45:42.780 --> 00:45:51.489
Frank: and also on. If we had meetings, the the only thing I would. I guess.

599
00:45:51.900 --> 00:45:54.539
Frank: Think about with these with these meetings is

600
00:45:55.500 --> 00:45:58.049
Frank: how they would look if we didn't have moderation.

601
00:46:02.320 --> 00:46:04.970
john bianculli: What do you mean? A moderator to.

602
00:46:05.360 --> 00:46:08.750
Frank: To kind of like Pradas, you know.

603
00:46:09.290 --> 00:46:14.990
john bianculli: Well, I mean we could well, I mean we could inspire each other.

604
00:46:15.390 --> 00:46:18.912
Frank: I mean, I know we're all adults, and we could. All you know, do that. I just

605
00:46:19.120 --> 00:46:19.420
john bianculli: Yeah.

606
00:46:19.720 --> 00:46:21.600
Frank: It'd be interesting to see how it looked.

607
00:46:22.580 --> 00:46:23.130
Dolores Albarracin: How are you?

608
00:46:23.130 --> 00:46:25.010
john bianculli: Well, I mean, we could in the chat

609
00:46:25.100 --> 00:46:28.219
john bianculli: maybe put, hey, what do you guys want to talk about this week?

610
00:46:28.310 --> 00:46:30.819
john bianculli: And maybe then we could

611
00:46:31.500 --> 00:46:36.610
john bianculli: pick 2 or 3 things out of the list, so that we stay on point and have a structured group.

612
00:46:37.330 --> 00:46:37.940
Frank: Sure.

613
00:46:38.720 --> 00:46:40.170
Dolores Albarracin: Like an agenda.

614
00:46:40.750 --> 00:46:41.380
john bianculli: Yeah.

615
00:46:43.050 --> 00:46:47.010
Dolores Albarracin: Yeah, or one of you could moderate one week. Yeah.

616
00:46:48.070 --> 00:46:50.730
john bianculli: No, we can alternate. If people want to do that.

617
00:46:53.020 --> 00:46:56.152
Dolores Albarracin: Yeah, so frank in in terms of

618
00:46:56.740 --> 00:47:01.720
Frank: Working through your grief. Let's assume the worst. Yeah, what.

619
00:47:01.990 --> 00:47:14.370
Dolores Albarracin: What works for you to go through the process as quickly and harass, you know painlessly as possible.

620
00:47:15.901 --> 00:47:18.484
Frank: My therapist is is

621
00:47:19.360 --> 00:47:30.810
Frank: is a she helps me with with a lot of things, and I could see her being a huge support for for this, and she usually gives me good ideas of of like how to

622
00:47:31.300 --> 00:47:47.290
Frank: just deal with my stuff sometimes that I don't always know the best ways to cope, because I've used drugs a lot for that in the past. So learning to deal with things in other ways

623
00:47:48.940 --> 00:47:53.580
Frank: kind of immersing myself more into my my hobbies and my

624
00:47:54.721 --> 00:47:58.090
Frank: my website. And you know, just

625
00:47:58.180 --> 00:48:02.590
Frank: putting my efforts into something that is is positive

626
00:48:03.390 --> 00:48:08.639
Frank: keeps my mind off of it from being obsessed with the grief.

627
00:48:10.740 --> 00:48:17.020
Dolores Albarracin: Do you do it? Do you meditate, or or anything religious or spiritual.

628
00:48:17.630 --> 00:48:31.079
Frank: I have a spiritual practice, and I you know I I do, chanting and and meditating. But like I said, it's it's it can be tough for me to to kind of.

629
00:48:31.446 --> 00:48:32.910
Dolores Albarracin: Get to do it.

630
00:48:32.910 --> 00:48:36.459
Frank: Get to do it. I do have a

631
00:48:36.920 --> 00:48:48.983
Frank: religious service that I attend every other week. I don't go every week because I don't want to get burnout, but the folks there are another

632
00:48:49.860 --> 00:48:52.879
Frank: way that I could potentially get some support too.

633
00:48:55.060 --> 00:48:57.729
Dolores Albarracin: So it seems like talking with others. Is.

634
00:48:59.440 --> 00:49:01.960
Dolores Albarracin: The most effective way for you. Right?

635
00:49:01.960 --> 00:49:03.339
Frank: Yeah, I would say so.

636
00:49:04.730 --> 00:49:08.799
Dolores Albarracin: Yeah. So could you plan? Maybe.

637
00:49:09.560 --> 00:49:14.060
Dolores Albarracin: uncle, a day with somebody, maybe even somebody from this group.

638
00:49:14.930 --> 00:49:17.409
Frank: Yeah, yeah, I mean, that's that's a that's a

639
00:49:17.730 --> 00:49:22.500
Frank: reasonable suggestion. And I think I have. You know,

640
00:49:24.145 --> 00:49:28.820
Frank: people that would like to hear from me. You know what?

641
00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:33.194
Frank: Not necessarily to talk gloom, doom, and gloom, but you know, like to

642
00:49:34.190 --> 00:49:37.820
Frank: People that just would want to chat, and that kind of gets my mind off of things.

643
00:49:40.470 --> 00:49:47.739
Dolores Albarracin: But would it be an another thing that you just cannot get yourself to to do, or or is is.

644
00:49:48.909 --> 00:49:52.100
Frank: I think that's that's usually manageable, you know.

645
00:49:52.590 --> 00:49:56.564
Frank: I I can't see that as being something that's too difficult to do.

646
00:49:57.410 --> 00:50:05.829
Frank: it's it's usually more stuff that I have to kind of be more self directed about like website work, or any of my

647
00:50:06.220 --> 00:50:13.640
Frank: you know, hobbies that I do that are self motivated, like, you know, riding my bike and all that stuff can.

648
00:50:15.110 --> 00:50:17.949
Frank: I can kind of talk myself out of it.

649
00:50:19.690 --> 00:50:23.179
Dolores Albarracin: Okay, so may maybe planning a

650
00:50:23.570 --> 00:50:26.869
Dolores Albarracin: 10 min check in with somebody every day.

651
00:50:27.160 --> 00:50:27.720
Frank: Yeah.

652
00:50:27.720 --> 00:50:30.879
Dolores Albarracin: Oh, talk can be helpful.

653
00:50:31.640 --> 00:50:55.970
Frank: Yeah. And and then, too, like, if I if I let the person know ahead of time, hey, I'm gonna give you a call then I'll have to have like an appointment. But, like you know, let them know that kind of puts me on the hook for it, so I don't like to, you know, disappoint people or let people down. So. That's another way. A motivator. To get me to actually go through with it, and not like, make excuses not to.

654
00:50:56.680 --> 00:50:57.480
Dolores Albarracin: Okay.

655
00:50:58.470 --> 00:51:08.329
Dolores Albarracin: Oh, that sounds like a reasonable plan, maybe 3 days a week, and and whenever you're feeling particularly down and and

656
00:51:08.690 --> 00:51:11.440
Dolores Albarracin: like not doing anything. Then the phone call.

657
00:51:12.100 --> 00:51:12.890
Frank: Yeah.

658
00:51:13.280 --> 00:51:14.230
Dolores Albarracin: Okay.

659
00:51:14.510 --> 00:51:20.380
Dolores Albarracin: So, John, how about you? The next 2 or or 3 months you have

660
00:51:20.780 --> 00:51:24.259
Dolores Albarracin: a lot going on, and we've talked about some of it. But

661
00:51:24.780 --> 00:51:30.370
Dolores Albarracin: how do you see this playing out? And and what are your main objectives?

662
00:51:31.470 --> 00:51:37.889
john bianculli: Well, 1st of all, try to keep up with the exercise, and some of the healthy habits that I picked up here.

663
00:51:39.140 --> 00:51:41.629
john bianculli: Try not to go back to my old ways.

664
00:51:43.360 --> 00:51:45.450
john bianculli: I'm gonna have to sort out

665
00:51:45.490 --> 00:51:50.520
john bianculli: friends to keep friends to maybe disassociate from.

666
00:51:51.470 --> 00:51:55.280
john bianculli: I mean one thing, this was kind of a nice escape, just due to the fact of

667
00:51:56.240 --> 00:52:00.589
john bianculli: I got to take myself out of that situation. Now I'm going back into it.

668
00:52:01.590 --> 00:52:07.475
john bianculli: But this time with a fresh perspective, hopefully, better coping skills and and

669
00:52:08.430 --> 00:52:12.399
john bianculli: and not isolating myself like I did the last time.

670
00:52:13.670 --> 00:52:16.420
Dolores Albarracin: So how can you?

671
00:52:16.420 --> 00:52:25.299
Dolores Albarracin: I mean, it seems really difficult, because you cannot go back to to friends who can be harmful. But at the same time you

672
00:52:25.640 --> 00:52:27.989
Dolores Albarracin: don't temporarily shouldn't be alone.

673
00:52:28.680 --> 00:52:33.630
Dolores Albarracin: So how do you solve that puzzle? It's.

674
00:52:33.990 --> 00:52:38.669
john bianculli: Well, I mean, I have probably about 4 sober friends that I can count on.

675
00:52:39.330 --> 00:52:42.049
john bianculli: So those ones are going to be the ones I

676
00:52:42.530 --> 00:52:44.680
john bianculli: I'm going to try to stay active with.

677
00:52:44.910 --> 00:52:48.690
john bianculli: I mean, one thing once is that some of them, that while

678
00:52:48.710 --> 00:52:51.519
john bianculli: the 67 days I've been here

679
00:52:51.700 --> 00:52:53.960
john bianculli: they've been there for me over the phone.

680
00:52:54.030 --> 00:52:57.680
john bianculli: I'm just hoping they're going to be the same supportive whenever I get back in the city.

681
00:52:59.060 --> 00:53:01.639
john bianculli: because I know some people. Okay, he's out of here.

682
00:53:02.420 --> 00:53:07.700
john bianculli: But hopefully, that'll be the same whenever I'm in in person

683
00:53:08.060 --> 00:53:09.980
john bianculli: as opposed to just phone a friend.

684
00:53:11.410 --> 00:53:15.230
Dolores Albarracin: And how do you keep the non sober ones away.

685
00:53:16.470 --> 00:53:18.849
john bianculli: I don't know that one I haven't figured out yet. I haven't.

686
00:53:18.900 --> 00:53:22.080
john bianculli: Well, I haven't come across that yet, because I'm in California.

687
00:53:23.430 --> 00:53:24.880
Dolores Albarracin: Door button.

688
00:53:24.880 --> 00:53:28.470
Dolores Albarracin: When do people think, yeah, ideas for John.

689
00:53:28.470 --> 00:53:30.449
Morgan Potts: Hit the ignore button.

690
00:53:32.140 --> 00:53:36.779
john bianculli: Well, I blocked a lot of them so. But but don't forget.

691
00:53:36.960 --> 00:53:40.589
john bianculli: When Pittsburgh is not that big of a town you run into people.

692
00:53:40.950 --> 00:53:41.760
Morgan Potts: Understood.

693
00:53:43.180 --> 00:53:46.529
john bianculli: I mean, it's a big town, but but you still run into people.

694
00:53:48.350 --> 00:53:51.970
Dolores Albarracin: And what places, though, where would you run into them?

695
00:53:53.039 --> 00:53:55.179
john bianculli: The Mall, the supermarket.

696
00:53:56.620 --> 00:54:01.240
john bianculli: This in the everyday to day, or just working in town, trying to get to work.

697
00:54:01.590 --> 00:54:06.789
Dolores Albarracin: So what happens? Let's say you find one. What's the name of one of these friends?

698
00:54:07.390 --> 00:54:09.830
john bianculli: A bad one or a good one.

699
00:54:10.050 --> 00:54:11.060
Dolores Albarracin: A bad one.

700
00:54:12.090 --> 00:54:22.809
john bianculli: Well, a bad one. Hopefully, it's at work, and I'm on my lunch break, so I don't have time to talk to them, and that's a good exit. Strategy like, Hey, I gotta get back to work.

701
00:54:23.200 --> 00:54:29.650
Dolores Albarracin: Oh, do you any of the bad ones at work, actually or no?

702
00:54:31.890 --> 00:54:35.420
john bianculli: I mean, there's a few people, but I really didn't associate with them at work.

703
00:54:36.800 --> 00:54:40.119
john bianculli: So I mean there are. There are, I mean.

704
00:54:40.160 --> 00:54:42.069
john bianculli: whenever I went to rehab, there was

705
00:54:42.220 --> 00:54:45.960
john bianculli: 2 other people from where I worked at at the rehab.

706
00:54:45.980 --> 00:54:49.879
john bianculli: That was why, the one time I actually had to leave one to pick a different location.

707
00:54:53.730 --> 00:54:55.120
Dolores Albarracin: Okay, so.

708
00:54:55.120 --> 00:54:58.200
john bianculli: But I mean those ones I didn't associate normally with anyways.

709
00:54:58.600 --> 00:55:00.259
john bianculli: So I mean at work.

710
00:55:00.603 --> 00:55:04.379
Dolores Albarracin: Ones that you, you think would become a problem for you.

711
00:55:05.120 --> 00:55:05.779
Dolores Albarracin: Well, yeah.

712
00:55:06.160 --> 00:55:06.540
john bianculli: Doug.

713
00:55:06.980 --> 00:55:09.040
Dolores Albarracin: That's what I got to figure out.

714
00:55:09.040 --> 00:55:14.340
Dolores Albarracin: Yeah. So what? Let's say, just to picture this, would you

715
00:55:15.590 --> 00:55:19.549
Dolores Albarracin: find them in a supermarket at a restaurant. Where would it be.

716
00:55:20.230 --> 00:55:21.150
john bianculli: No?

717
00:55:21.870 --> 00:55:25.890
john bianculli: Well, probably one of them standing still, probably at a bus stop or.

718
00:55:25.890 --> 00:55:26.360
Dolores Albarracin: Okay.

719
00:55:26.360 --> 00:55:29.999
john bianculli: Yeah, I mean at the bus on a bus.

720
00:55:30.590 --> 00:55:35.210
Dolores Albarracin: Okay, let's say, let's look at that situation. What

721
00:55:35.620 --> 00:55:40.040
Dolores Albarracin: what ideas do people have of of what he could do.

722
00:55:42.930 --> 00:55:47.640
Dolores Albarracin: Keep it very, very limited, I know.

723
00:55:47.640 --> 00:55:48.290
Morgan Potts: I would.

724
00:55:48.290 --> 00:55:49.800
Dolores Albarracin: I've encouraged them.

725
00:55:54.130 --> 00:55:55.749
Dolores Albarracin: Yeah, go ahead, Morgan.

726
00:55:56.070 --> 00:56:02.820
Morgan Potts: Well, I I mean I I understand that it's not. It's never as simple as this. But you know

727
00:56:02.950 --> 00:56:14.109
Morgan Potts: you don't owe anybody an explanation for anything, John. And if you run into Chad, okay, run into Chad in the grocery store. Hey, man, what's up? Where you been

728
00:56:14.470 --> 00:56:16.039
Morgan Potts: just taking a break.

729
00:56:16.420 --> 00:56:32.339
Morgan Potts: Oh, yeah, I mean, and you just learn real quickly, like, yep, anyway. Hey? I gotta run. See ya! And then you don't. You don't have. You don't have to owe them an explanation. You don't have to tell them your business. Yep. Just took a break. Went to California for a little while. Yep, hey? I gotta go bye.

730
00:56:33.480 --> 00:56:35.749
Morgan Potts: I know that's a lot easier said than done, but

731
00:56:36.370 --> 00:56:40.870
Morgan Potts: there's no need to get into the dregs with them, because you don't want to reestablish that relationship. Dude.

732
00:56:42.200 --> 00:56:44.886
john bianculli: Well agreed, agreed on that part hopefully.

733
00:56:45.590 --> 00:56:50.440
john bianculli: and a few of them were kind of stalkers. So that's the other thing I'm kind of worried about as well, but.

734
00:56:51.680 --> 00:56:53.490
Dolores Albarracin: What were they doing? Sorry.

735
00:56:54.100 --> 00:56:56.549
john bianculli: Waiting for me outside of my job.

736
00:56:57.100 --> 00:56:58.010
Petra Teeter 237121: God.

737
00:56:58.380 --> 00:57:03.590
john bianculli: They didn't know my exact schedule like I rotated my days off my time that I came in.

738
00:57:04.450 --> 00:57:05.530
john bianculli: Do that? No, and

739
00:57:05.700 --> 00:57:09.979
john bianculli: yeah, a couple of them kind of were standing outside for a few hours trying to figure out what my new schedule was.

740
00:57:09.980 --> 00:57:14.730
Dolores Albarracin: Well, it's almost like I mean, it seems almost stalking.

741
00:57:15.470 --> 00:57:17.470
john bianculli: Yeah, unfortunately.

742
00:57:18.280 --> 00:57:20.670
john bianculli: But I mean the good news. So it's the

743
00:57:20.910 --> 00:57:24.789
john bianculli: we relocated. So I mean, that's the other thing, too. I'm kind of glad about.

744
00:57:24.790 --> 00:57:25.859
Dolores Albarracin: Add, call.

745
00:57:26.260 --> 00:57:34.199
john bianculli: And we're in a better area of town. So the yeah, the security guards aren't gonna allow people to stand in front of the building like the other ones did.

746
00:57:34.730 --> 00:57:38.529
Dolores Albarracin: Yeah. And if they do, you should probably tell them not to.

747
00:57:39.040 --> 00:57:42.910
john bianculli: Yeah. Well, the new building, the security is way. Better.

748
00:57:43.150 --> 00:57:47.630
john bianculli: If somebody's standing, there's no bus stops or any reason to be standing there.

749
00:57:47.750 --> 00:57:49.719
john bianculli: So they told people to move along.

750
00:57:51.550 --> 00:57:52.460
Dolores Albarracin: Okay.

751
00:57:52.910 --> 00:57:57.109
john bianculli: Yeah, that part, that voting you really can't just stand there without a reason.

752
00:57:57.782 --> 00:58:06.750
Dolores Albarracin: Like Morgan Morgan's ideas. What do they tell, John? I heard you are in rehab in California, or something.

753
00:58:07.780 --> 00:58:10.139
john bianculli: Well, I don't know how many people

754
00:58:11.350 --> 00:58:15.320
john bianculli: there. There's only like maybe 4 people that know I'm in rehab.

755
00:58:15.840 --> 00:58:18.470
john bianculli: You're on the other people. I just disappeared.

756
00:58:18.830 --> 00:58:19.670
Morgan Potts: You're on vacation.

757
00:58:20.450 --> 00:58:21.310
john bianculli: Yeah.

758
00:58:23.810 --> 00:58:37.379
Frank: Or I mean, you could also say that you have a business opportunity, you know. And with, without really getting into, you know a any more any greater detail, and just kind of leave it at that. And

759
00:58:37.550 --> 00:58:39.989
Frank: I've had to to learn to kind of

760
00:58:40.110 --> 00:58:43.290
Frank: shut conversation short sometimes with people that I don't

761
00:58:43.400 --> 00:58:46.890
Frank: that from my past life or people that you know, I just don't. Wanna

762
00:58:47.170 --> 00:58:54.059
Frank: you know, talk with anymore because it it brings up old shit and old behavior so that can be tough, though I I understand.

763
00:58:54.060 --> 00:58:55.280
Dolores Albarracin: How did you manage?

764
00:58:55.280 --> 00:58:55.820
john bianculli: Yeah.

765
00:58:56.060 --> 00:58:57.189
Dolores Albarracin: Frank, how do.

766
00:58:57.190 --> 00:59:20.655
Frank: Well, it it was. It was a bit easier for me because I I moved to another state, you know, and so I didn't have to like worry about seeing any of these people when I would go out in public because I left the State and nobody's gonna follow me here, you know. So that made it easier. And I also got a new, a new phone, a new phone number

767
00:59:20.980 --> 00:59:33.900
Frank: which helped me out a lot. I don't know if that's realistic for you. It isn't for everyone, but it worked out for me that way. No one had a way to contact me. And I wasn't really on social media anyway. And if now, if someone.

768
00:59:34.100 --> 00:59:51.630
Frank: I I only have it to where people I know can reach out. And so if someone, friend request me that is either of my past life, or or whatever someone I just don't know or don't want to talk to then I just ignore them. And don't you know I I don't accept their friend request, so I don't get any contact from them.

769
00:59:51.810 --> 00:59:54.140
Frank: Keeps me secluded enough.

770
00:59:55.840 --> 00:59:58.490
Dolores Albarracin: Lou, you want to provide some thoughts.

771
00:59:59.580 --> 01:00:05.000
Lewis: Hey? I was gonna say, because I I've gone through that before falling out with friends that

772
01:00:05.050 --> 01:00:10.990
Lewis: you might have, you know, gone out for drinks with, and somebody spent more money, or you went to go

773
01:00:11.050 --> 01:00:21.389
Lewis: get whatever type of drug. And someone spends more money. Those type of things this messages like you were saying, avoid any situations you could be around them.

774
01:00:21.400 --> 01:00:24.680
Lewis: If it comes to the point where you actually have to

775
01:00:24.910 --> 01:00:30.559
Lewis: leave altogether the location, and that's the best idea to do. You have to look out for yourself rather than

776
01:00:30.650 --> 01:00:33.770
Lewis: trying to save the couple of people that you considered friends.

777
01:00:36.620 --> 01:00:42.730
Dolores Albarracin: How about if you said something like, Yeah, good to see you. But I I got Covid. So I.

778
01:00:43.610 --> 01:00:44.090
john bianculli: Yeah.

779
01:00:45.120 --> 01:00:46.310
Dolores Albarracin: Can't congrat.

780
01:00:46.310 --> 01:00:46.720
Lewis: Just.

781
01:00:47.390 --> 01:00:48.010
Dolores Albarracin: That would.

782
01:00:48.010 --> 01:00:56.139
Lewis: With my situation. It was just I was like, well, I you know my lease is running up and I'm gonna have to move. It's been cool hanging out with you guys and

783
01:00:56.220 --> 01:01:04.219
Lewis: just didn't hang out that much, because then I started realizing I was the one contributing more amount of money to doing stuff. But I really wasn't always

784
01:01:04.320 --> 01:01:11.809
Lewis: drinking, you know, or it was just more to hang out and be buddies. And it was like, I feel like I'm being used a little bit, so I gotta

785
01:01:12.030 --> 01:01:13.640
Lewis: get out of this situation.

786
01:01:15.380 --> 01:01:19.700
Dolores Albarracin: Yeah. So you have some ideas, and

787
01:01:20.580 --> 01:01:25.160
Dolores Albarracin: I'm sure you'll, you know, figure out what to do. But

788
01:01:26.190 --> 01:01:31.419
Dolores Albarracin: the question for you, John, is, how much do you value this this

789
01:01:32.160 --> 01:01:37.150
Dolores Albarracin: new situation? You're in right coming out of prehab.

790
01:01:38.470 --> 01:01:42.859
john bianculli: No, I value it a lot. I mean, that's 1 thing I don't want to do is

791
01:01:43.090 --> 01:01:45.829
john bianculli: I mean, I'm trying to do everything right this time.

792
01:01:46.270 --> 01:01:49.930
john bianculli: So I mean, with this being my 3rd stint, I

793
01:01:49.940 --> 01:01:53.919
john bianculli: I'm hoping it's gonna be like baseball rolls, 3 strikes. And it's out, you know.

794
01:01:54.930 --> 01:01:56.709
john bianculli: I don't want to go for a 4.th

795
01:02:00.420 --> 01:02:07.500
Dolores Albarracin: Well, I you know we're all really proud of.

796
01:02:07.590 --> 01:02:11.269
Dolores Albarracin: You know the success you've had, and I think you're

797
01:02:12.120 --> 01:02:17.939
Dolores Albarracin: really clear on what you want what you value. And and hopefully, you can protect

798
01:02:18.860 --> 01:02:23.950
Dolores Albarracin: yourself from all these potential sources of problems. Sam.

799
01:02:25.420 --> 01:02:29.430
john bianculli: Yeah, I mean, I have to make sure that I don't start isolating, sleeping all the time.

800
01:02:30.220 --> 01:02:36.340
john bianculli: I have to make sure to what I mean. Still, keep up with the exercise. That'll be a good thing.

801
01:02:37.760 --> 01:02:41.710
john bianculli: I mean, it's a matter of you have to do everything in moderation. I mean, I'm not. Gonna

802
01:02:41.950 --> 01:02:46.020
john bianculli: I mean even worst case scenario. If I go to the gym too much, at least it's a healthy activity.

803
01:02:46.020 --> 01:02:51.730
Dolores Albarracin: Yes, yes, that wouldn't be a bad thing.

804
01:02:52.310 --> 01:02:53.040
john bianculli: Yeah.

805
01:02:53.040 --> 01:02:53.700
Dolores Albarracin: Yeah.

806
01:02:54.800 --> 01:03:01.480
Dolores Albarracin: So, Lou, how are you gonna proceed to find a job.

807
01:03:03.094 --> 01:03:04.920
Lewis: I think I'm willing to start.

808
01:03:05.180 --> 01:03:10.019
Lewis: Sorry. I think I'm actually going to start reaching out more with people and socializing.

809
01:03:10.320 --> 01:03:16.659
Lewis: That's been something I haven't done in the past. I would always go through online or Internet.

810
01:03:17.380 --> 01:03:21.029
Lewis: or just you know, my my own search as opposed to

811
01:03:21.330 --> 01:03:28.029
Lewis: socializing and finding out where people work and what's a good place to work, what's not a good place to work so.

812
01:03:29.160 --> 01:03:30.020
Dolores Albarracin: So ask him.

813
01:03:30.020 --> 01:03:31.100
john bianculli: One minor.

814
01:03:31.100 --> 01:03:31.630
Dolores Albarracin: We.

815
01:03:32.050 --> 01:03:33.930
john bianculli: One minor suggestion.

816
01:03:34.160 --> 01:03:37.279
john bianculli: Just get any job that you can find.

817
01:03:37.360 --> 01:03:40.950
john bianculli: because whenever you have a job, even if it isn't the best.

818
01:03:40.960 --> 01:03:44.069
john bianculli: it still makes you more employable than not having one period.

819
01:03:45.860 --> 01:03:56.080
john bianculli: I mean, even if it's a dishwasher. I mean, just get any type of entry level job that you can, because it actually makes you more employable when you actually have a job

820
01:03:56.200 --> 01:03:58.029
john bianculli: rather than nothing. Period.

821
01:03:58.850 --> 01:04:00.110
Lewis: Very, very true.

822
01:04:00.960 --> 01:04:02.740
Lewis: It says she's.

823
01:04:02.740 --> 01:04:09.339
john bianculli: 11 or so. If you have 7, 11, I mean some of them. They are actually paying really high wages.

824
01:04:10.340 --> 01:04:10.980
Lewis: Yeah.

825
01:04:11.100 --> 01:04:15.609
Lewis: My, my whole thing now is just to find something that's steady. I can. I can deal with

826
01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:19.489
Lewis: not liking my job, but if it's steady, then I can definitely keep it

827
01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:24.599
Lewis: as opposed to like. There's been times before where it's like the job isn't too steady.

828
01:04:24.880 --> 01:04:30.009
Lewis: and it's starting to get on my nerves. Then that's when I go searching for another job or.

829
01:04:31.030 --> 01:04:39.140
john bianculli: Yeah, I mean construction work. That's a good thing to get and easy to find. But the problem, though, is that the job's finished, and then you have to keep looking and looking.

830
01:04:39.600 --> 01:04:40.430
Lewis: Exactly.

831
01:04:41.040 --> 01:04:41.710
Lewis: Yep.

832
01:04:41.710 --> 01:04:47.830
Dolores Albarracin: So when when do you plan on on starting this, this search.

833
01:04:48.770 --> 01:04:55.349
Lewis: Well, I actually kind of already started. I stay to myself mainly if I'm going to these shelters

834
01:04:55.980 --> 01:04:57.780
Lewis: because I've had a lot of

835
01:04:58.070 --> 01:05:01.690
Lewis: issues with trusting people that were saying they were my friends, but.

836
01:05:03.420 --> 01:05:04.059
Dolores Albarracin: A lot of.

837
01:05:04.060 --> 01:05:05.470
Lewis: Think I got a job.

838
01:05:05.470 --> 01:05:06.040
Dolores Albarracin: Yeah.

839
01:05:06.040 --> 01:05:07.370
Lewis: Geez! No.

840
01:05:07.370 --> 01:05:07.900
Dolores Albarracin: Your friend.

841
01:05:09.270 --> 01:05:14.769
Lewis: Yeah, but he's he's working at this gambling Casino.

842
01:05:15.230 --> 01:05:19.519
Lewis: So he's he keeps telling me that they need people. They need people, and it's out of the way.

843
01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:23.309
Lewis: but I'm sure they're paying. Well, if it's a gambling Casino.

844
01:05:24.970 --> 01:05:28.239
john bianculli: That would be good, because you would probably get benefits through them.

845
01:05:29.250 --> 01:05:29.920
Lewis: Yeah.

846
01:05:30.630 --> 01:05:31.409
Lewis: So I've already.

847
01:05:31.410 --> 01:05:31.729
john bianculli: The number.

848
01:05:31.730 --> 01:05:32.300
Lewis: Yeah, I do.

849
01:05:32.300 --> 01:05:34.070
john bianculli: That stuff to start out with.

850
01:05:34.080 --> 01:05:36.369
john bianculli: But you could. You could work your way up.

851
01:05:37.240 --> 01:05:43.039
Lewis: Right, exactly, since it's something that's just starting. I could probably work my way up to being the supervisor.

852
01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:46.169
Petra Teeter 237121: Is that Lewis?

853
01:05:46.970 --> 01:05:51.800
Petra Teeter 237121: Would would the Casino be something, though? Are you? Are you

854
01:05:52.480 --> 01:05:54.899
Petra Teeter 237121: Would that make you wanna gamble?

855
01:05:55.640 --> 01:05:56.880
Petra Teeter 237121: I'm just asking.

856
01:05:56.880 --> 01:05:58.440
john bianculli: Drank or drank.

857
01:05:58.440 --> 01:06:03.270
Petra Teeter 237121: Force me, but I'm just saying if it were to, that would be bad right.

858
01:06:04.310 --> 01:06:11.804
Lewis: Oh, yeah, that is true that it? There is that element there. But I'm I can't say that I'm super susceptible to it.

859
01:06:12.470 --> 01:06:18.359
Lewis: I gamble like through a app, but that's an occasional thing. So it's not like I have.

860
01:06:19.080 --> 01:06:26.840
Lewis: I have the ability to be addicted to stuff, but it is still something to look out for. Since I am, I would be working in that element. That is true.

861
01:06:27.500 --> 01:06:31.930
john bianculli: Well, and the other bigger one alcohol. Don't forget casinos. People get drunk at them.

862
01:06:32.780 --> 01:06:38.068
Lewis: Yeah, and then having to serve it.

863
01:06:39.240 --> 01:06:47.330
Morgan Potts: Hey, Lou, if I could interject, this is Morgan and if I could interject, because I've worked in the industry.

864
01:06:47.820 --> 01:06:55.799
Morgan Potts: you're not a man of weak constitution. So I know you can handle yourself. But I just wanted just to remind you that the service industry.

865
01:06:56.200 --> 01:07:03.179
Morgan Potts: as you probably know, there can be a lot of temptation there. So just keep that in mind going forward. Okay.

866
01:07:03.826 --> 01:07:09.459
Lewis: You know that is true. I didn't. I didn't really think about it too much, but that's very true.

867
01:07:10.560 --> 01:07:15.320
Dolores Albarracin: What other job are are you thinking about? Besides.

868
01:07:15.681 --> 01:07:18.570
Lewis: I'm trying to get back into resale because

869
01:07:18.680 --> 01:07:20.900
Lewis: well, hold on a second. This is gonna be

870
01:07:21.150 --> 01:07:26.561
Lewis: so far is here for a minute. But getting back into retail. I was telling the

871
01:07:27.400 --> 01:07:33.069
Lewis: Basically, it's the the whole homeless division for the county, and they can only visit certain

872
01:07:33.110 --> 01:07:36.209
Lewis: parts of the county certain days. So I met with this guy.

873
01:07:36.490 --> 01:07:42.330
Lewis: and he basically said that they will set me up with 2 or 3 outfits for interviews.

874
01:07:42.340 --> 01:07:45.890
Lewis: because I told him. I think that's why I'm not getting my jobs, I went on.

875
01:07:46.470 --> 01:07:50.679
Lewis: Usually when I set up interviews and go on my job run. I'm trying to find.

876
01:07:51.420 --> 01:07:57.790
Lewis: you know, as many places to to interview with being be seen as with as many people. So then that way I can get a job quicker.

877
01:07:58.350 --> 01:08:02.289
Lewis: But it just seemed like it was that plan wasn't working for me this time. Where else?

878
01:08:02.570 --> 01:08:05.169
Lewis: And I started thinking, well, maybe it's because

879
01:08:05.410 --> 01:08:11.509
Lewis: I wore jeans in this interview, or I wore sneakers in this interview, when I'm used to being dressed up, and you know.

880
01:08:11.680 --> 01:08:13.859
Lewis: really trying to present myself, so

881
01:08:14.210 --> 01:08:17.289
Lewis: I think I kind of lost some confidence in doing that, and.

882
01:08:19.089 --> 01:08:22.039
john bianculli: Well to save a buck. Have you considered thrift stores.

883
01:08:22.930 --> 01:08:24.180
Lewis: Oh, yeah, yeah, that's what I'm busy.

884
01:08:24.180 --> 01:08:32.640
john bianculli: Going to take you a while to find things that are decent. But I mean, if you put the time and effort into it, you're not going to spend that much money, and you can get good clothes.

885
01:08:32.700 --> 01:08:33.769
john bianculli: It just takes a while.

886
01:08:33.779 --> 01:08:34.239
Lewis: That's fine!

887
01:08:35.649 --> 01:08:36.149
Frank: Captain's.

888
01:08:36.149 --> 01:08:41.240
Lewis: Yeah, they're finding good sizing. And then also newer stuff. Yeah.

889
01:08:42.180 --> 01:08:46.590
john bianculli: I mean, like the one I went to. I found 3, 95 Tommy Bahama shirts.

890
01:08:46.790 --> 01:08:49.750
john bianculli: and those are normally pretty expensive at Macy's, you know.

891
01:08:50.310 --> 01:08:56.656
Lewis: Yeah, that's basically my whole game plan. Then.

892
01:08:57.100 --> 01:09:00.320
john bianculli: You should have seen how long and big the rack was.

893
01:09:00.359 --> 01:09:03.429
john bianculli: and I had to go through about 300 shirts to find 2 of them.

894
01:09:04.720 --> 01:09:05.600
Lewis: Oh, man!

895
01:09:05.939 --> 01:09:10.080
john bianculli: Yeah. So I mean, yeah, it takes you a while to get to the good stuff. But.

896
01:09:11.490 --> 01:09:17.529
Lewis: That's pretty much how I've been with winter jackets. I still haven't gotten an official winter jacket, but

897
01:09:18.460 --> 01:09:23.609
Lewis: should be coming around the season for everybody having one for me to be able to get a good one.

898
01:09:24.657 --> 01:09:30.689
Dolores Albarracin: In terms of your sort of plan for for this this phase loom.

899
01:09:31.189 --> 01:09:34.719
Dolores Albarracin: you would get into the place for 3 months and

900
01:09:35.859 --> 01:09:43.419
Dolores Albarracin: and have the this person was going to give you the outfits. Maybe that set up. So you have the outfits. Shortly after.

901
01:09:44.620 --> 01:09:49.940
Lewis: No, no! The the gentleman that had me sign the the paperwork for the assistance.

902
01:09:50.140 --> 01:09:53.200
Lewis: you know. I was telling them what was going on with me and stuff.

903
01:09:53.290 --> 01:09:56.189
Lewis: He asked me why I didn't have a job. If I haven't been employed.

904
01:09:56.190 --> 01:09:56.680
Dolores Albarracin: Okay.

905
01:09:56.680 --> 01:09:57.549
Lewis: And whenever

906
01:09:57.690 --> 01:10:04.959
Lewis: so I explained that to him he said, well, you know we got, he said. What size are you? He just looked at me. What size are you in pants? What size are you in shoes?

907
01:10:05.390 --> 01:10:09.836
Lewis: Cause? If I have khakis and dress shoes, I'm good. I could always go to the thrift store like

908
01:10:10.793 --> 01:10:12.240
Dolores Albarracin: Help out!

909
01:10:12.240 --> 01:10:12.690
Lewis: Kiss.

910
01:10:12.690 --> 01:10:15.299
Dolores Albarracin: Identify some pieces for you.

911
01:10:15.300 --> 01:10:16.899
Lewis: Right. Yes, yes, ma'am.

912
01:10:17.200 --> 01:10:18.819
john bianculli: Are you in Pennsylvania?

913
01:10:19.750 --> 01:10:24.480
Lewis: No. Virginia. We're about 35 miles south of DC.

914
01:10:24.650 --> 01:10:26.079
Lewis: So it is.

915
01:10:26.080 --> 01:10:26.609
john bianculli: Good for you.

916
01:10:26.610 --> 01:10:27.270
Lewis: Fluent.

917
01:10:28.719 --> 01:10:30.319
john bianculli: Something called Job Corps.

918
01:10:31.110 --> 01:10:34.770
Lewis: Yeah, we have a in Pennsylvania. We have something called Job Corps.

919
01:10:35.100 --> 01:10:40.700
john bianculli: And then Job Corps also has other things like dress for success. I mean, that's a Pittsburgh thing.

920
01:10:40.760 --> 01:10:45.089
john bianculli: They try to see if maybe you have a job court something like that. There gotta be something through your state.

921
01:10:45.100 --> 01:10:48.490
john bianculli: They might be able to help you, but just close for a

922
01:10:48.961 --> 01:10:51.630
john bianculli: close you close for a interview.

923
01:10:52.630 --> 01:10:55.199
Frank: Dress, for success is a national thing.

924
01:10:55.620 --> 01:10:56.460
john bianculli: I didn't know that.

925
01:10:56.460 --> 01:10:58.150
Lewis: Bye, yeah.

926
01:10:58.380 --> 01:11:00.490
john bianculli: Yeah. I looked it up. Address for success.

927
01:11:00.846 --> 01:11:04.680
Dolores Albarracin: And find the link for for Luke, for that.

928
01:11:04.680 --> 01:11:05.080
Lewis: Yeah.

929
01:11:06.090 --> 01:11:06.650
john bianculli: Okay.

930
01:11:06.650 --> 01:11:07.040
john bianculli: Record

931
01:11:07.040 --> 01:11:13.779
john bianculli: success. That one. They'll they'll hook you up with the suit dress shoes tied, I mean, literally a whole outfit.

932
01:11:14.130 --> 01:11:20.799
Lewis: Right, because that's what I'm starting to see now is, even though I'm in this situation, I still have.

933
01:11:21.130 --> 01:11:28.700
Lewis: You know you still want quality stuff. You still want to look a certain way. So it's hard to let go of that, even though you're struggling, is is the hard part.

934
01:11:28.700 --> 01:11:31.410
john bianculli: Well, don't forget the dress for success.

935
01:11:31.530 --> 01:11:38.800
john bianculli: It's donated close. Don't get me wrong, but I mean don't forget there, there are good things in there.

936
01:11:39.130 --> 01:11:39.640
john bianculli: I mean.

937
01:11:39.640 --> 01:11:40.100
Lewis: Yeah.

938
01:11:40.100 --> 01:11:43.320
john bianculli: It's not. They're not going to send you out there with suits, with a hole in it.

939
01:11:44.080 --> 01:11:44.510
Lewis: Right, right.

940
01:11:44.510 --> 01:11:51.420
john bianculli: And you know what I mean. And and the one even tailored them. If you needed to order. If you needed one outward

941
01:11:51.530 --> 01:11:58.659
john bianculli: that organization. They're not going to send you out there with the patches over your backside and holes in your name.

942
01:11:59.176 --> 01:12:00.209
Lewis: Right away.

943
01:12:00.210 --> 01:12:04.739
john bianculli: They'll make sure that you look professional because they want you to succeed. That's their goal.

944
01:12:05.140 --> 01:12:09.859
Frank: Hey, hey, Bolis, real quick, are you in? Are you near to? Richmond?

945
01:12:11.497 --> 01:12:15.520
Lewis: Further north. I'm about 80 miles north of Richmond.

946
01:12:16.520 --> 01:12:22.399
Frank: Okay, so are you closer to Washington? DC.

947
01:12:22.400 --> 01:12:30.570
Lewis: 2, 2, 1, you type in the the name of the place, and then 2, 2, 1, 9, 1, and it'll probably give me the closest one to the Zip code.

948
01:12:31.070 --> 01:12:32.910
Frank: I see. Okay, cool.

949
01:12:32.910 --> 01:12:33.710
Lewis: Yeah.

950
01:12:35.270 --> 01:12:35.590
john bianculli: Also.

951
01:12:35.590 --> 01:12:38.059
Lewis: That's how I usually put stuff on.

952
01:12:38.780 --> 01:12:41.950
john bianculli: Also, too, you might want to look through programs through goodwill.

953
01:12:42.080 --> 01:12:48.209
john bianculli: because some of the programs they actually give you goodwill gift cards. And then you your own stuff.

954
01:12:48.700 --> 01:12:51.149
Lewis: Their own outfit from there. Yeah, that makes sense.

955
01:12:51.750 --> 01:12:54.140
john bianculli: And also 2 goodwill offers job training.

956
01:12:54.920 --> 01:12:55.760
Lewis: Yeah.

957
01:12:55.760 --> 01:12:56.929
Dolores Albarracin: That's good to know.

958
01:12:56.930 --> 01:12:57.830
Lewis: For sure.

959
01:12:58.280 --> 01:13:09.440
Dolores Albarracin: So it seems like you have a plan, the place, the suit, the job search, and and we very much look forward to hearing about all of this.

960
01:13:10.050 --> 01:13:10.716
Lewis: Oh, right!

961
01:13:11.050 --> 01:13:18.260
Dolores Albarracin: When I go to pat again. I know Pat you mentioned want to say

962
01:13:19.220 --> 01:13:21.150
Dolores Albarracin: with the treadmill, and then also

963
01:13:22.160 --> 01:13:28.629
Dolores Albarracin: changes to your diet. Do you want to summarize for us? What what do you like to achieve in the next 2 or 3 months.

964
01:13:30.375 --> 01:13:36.370
Patricia Renaud: To continue on that same track and lose weight. And just.

965
01:13:36.780 --> 01:13:39.449
Patricia Renaud: you know, get healthier all around.

966
01:13:41.230 --> 01:13:42.860
Patricia Renaud: That's the main goal.

967
01:13:43.650 --> 01:13:46.440
Dolores Albarracin: Okay, do you? Do you anticipate?

968
01:13:46.450 --> 01:13:52.280
Dolores Albarracin: Or what could make this sort of non-workout?

969
01:13:53.260 --> 01:13:58.529
Dolores Albarracin: What could happen that prevents you from realizing this objective.

970
01:14:00.266 --> 01:14:06.500
Patricia Renaud: I don't think anything, because I just got the motivation now, and I just want to continue it.

971
01:14:08.290 --> 01:14:17.040
Patricia Renaud: If I happen to, you know, fall off the track, and you know, just have somebody there to

972
01:14:17.420 --> 01:14:19.000
Patricia Renaud: keep motivating me.

973
01:14:19.670 --> 01:14:21.980
Dolores Albarracin: To to get some feedback or ideas.

974
01:14:22.754 --> 01:14:23.529
Patricia Renaud: Yeah.

975
01:14:23.530 --> 01:14:29.439
Dolores Albarracin: Great and and Petra, do you plan on staying with the treadmill.

976
01:14:30.030 --> 01:14:33.239
Petra Teeter 237121: Yeah, for as long as it works. Yeah.

977
01:14:33.940 --> 01:14:38.229
Petra Teeter 237121: it's just if the pain gets worse, then I'm gonna do something else.

978
01:14:38.370 --> 01:14:43.860
Petra Teeter 237121: I also tried all the different supplements called S.

979
01:14:44.070 --> 01:14:45.530
Petra Teeter 237121: Spm.

980
01:14:45.760 --> 01:14:48.370
Petra Teeter 237121: They're like a step up from fish oil.

981
01:14:49.373 --> 01:14:53.540
Petra Teeter 237121: So it's I will always try

982
01:14:54.770 --> 01:14:55.610
Dolores Albarracin: But for now.

983
01:14:55.610 --> 01:15:01.040
Petra Teeter 237121: It's hard when it doesn't work. I get pretty frustrated because, like I said, I've been doing this for many years, so.

984
01:15:01.890 --> 01:15:07.779
Dolores Albarracin: Treadmill, and I I see Frank has a link for Lou.

985
01:15:08.050 --> 01:15:12.280
john bianculli: And don't forget if they're not geographically close to you. Still call them anyways.

986
01:15:12.300 --> 01:15:16.860
john bianculli: because then maybe they could take that a step further to give you resources you might not be aware of.

987
01:15:17.190 --> 01:15:17.890
Dolores Albarracin: Yes.

988
01:15:18.660 --> 01:15:19.570
Petra Teeter 237121: How is?

989
01:15:19.570 --> 01:15:24.250
john bianculli: Appreciate, appreciate that. I'll screenshot it once I see it here in a sec

990
01:15:24.250 --> 01:15:30.199
john bianculli: like with me. I wasn't aware that was a nationwide organization. I just thought it was a Pittsburgh thing, but they helped me out.

991
01:15:31.100 --> 01:15:40.339
Dolores Albarracin: So, Petra, yeah, in addition to the treadmill, thinking not of supplements, but another form of exercise seems.

992
01:15:40.750 --> 01:15:43.680
Dolores Albarracin: This is something that you really like, and

993
01:15:43.730 --> 01:15:49.349
Dolores Albarracin: you also want to lose weight. Would there be any other form of movement that might be helpful.

994
01:15:49.350 --> 01:15:52.659
Petra Teeter 237121: I'm a runner, and I'm a boxer

995
01:15:53.110 --> 01:15:56.050
Petra Teeter 237121: that's bold and not good for my pain.

996
01:15:56.630 --> 01:15:58.050
Petra Teeter 237121: Sorry about that.

997
01:15:58.050 --> 01:15:59.880
Dolores Albarracin: Are you doing all these things?

998
01:16:00.730 --> 01:16:01.320
Dolores Albarracin: Maybe.

999
01:16:01.320 --> 01:16:05.050
Dolores Albarracin: No, definitely, not the boxing. Okay.

1000
01:16:05.940 --> 01:16:09.759
Petra Teeter 237121: I mean I can, but it makes stuff much worse.

1001
01:16:10.390 --> 01:16:11.080
Petra Teeter 237121: That's not.

1002
01:16:11.080 --> 01:16:13.199
Dolores Albarracin: Same day. But so thank you.

1003
01:16:13.200 --> 01:16:14.469
Petra Teeter 237121: The next day.

1004
01:16:14.630 --> 01:16:15.999
Dolores Albarracin: Not a hiking group.

1005
01:16:16.120 --> 01:16:16.729
Dolores Albarracin: How are you?

1006
01:16:19.440 --> 01:16:20.450
Petra Teeter 237121: Yeah, I guess.

1007
01:16:22.080 --> 01:16:23.270
Lewis: I could do that.

1008
01:16:23.270 --> 01:16:24.020
john bianculli: What about?

1009
01:16:24.620 --> 01:16:30.470
Petra Teeter 237121: But yeah, what about your local Mall? Do they have a Mall Walkers group like Pittsburgh. They

1010
01:16:30.470 --> 01:16:31.580
Petra Teeter 237121: kind of help.

1011
01:16:31.950 --> 01:16:39.760
john bianculli: Yeah, but in. But but they do like, I don't know some of the Malls in Pittsburgh they actually have a group that you can join, and they may not.

1012
01:16:40.590 --> 01:16:41.570
Petra Teeter 237121: Yeah.

1013
01:16:43.050 --> 01:16:45.130
john bianculli: I mean, it's kind of nice, because it's in the wintertime.

1014
01:16:45.130 --> 01:16:46.959
Petra Teeter 237121: 30 min drive.

1015
01:16:47.330 --> 01:16:55.870
Petra Teeter 237121: Yeah. I think we have lost some of those walkers, because it was not too long ago. Somebody

1016
01:16:56.010 --> 01:17:00.281
Petra Teeter 237121: fired shots in there, but didn't go over too well.

1017
01:17:01.204 --> 01:17:12.229
Petra Teeter 237121: But yes, that is an opportunity. As the weather, I mean I'm in North Carolina, so I cannot complain too much. But we do have January and February, where it gets tricky.

1018
01:17:12.640 --> 01:17:16.260
Petra Teeter 237121: So that is, you know, it's an option.

1019
01:17:16.410 --> 01:17:24.470
Petra Teeter 237121: I guess I could overcome that. I absolutely hate them all. I'm more. You can throw me in the woods, and I'll be happy.

1020
01:17:25.290 --> 01:17:34.670
john bianculli: Well, did anybody else look up the app, the Phoenix? That also has sober activities? I don't know if they cover every neighborhood, but if you put in your Zip code.

1021
01:17:34.740 --> 01:17:41.980
john bianculli: it's sober activities, like I found a group in Pittsburgh that I'm going to go to that. They like horror movies.

1022
01:17:43.160 --> 01:17:45.459
john bianculli: And they do horror movies every Friday.

1023
01:17:45.520 --> 01:17:48.060
john bianculli: I mean, it's a sober activity to do.

1024
01:17:49.980 --> 01:17:52.540
Dolores Albarracin: Okay. So you look for a group

1025
01:17:53.110 --> 01:17:56.369
Dolores Albarracin: to do something physical. Petra? Yes.

1026
01:17:56.370 --> 01:17:57.130
Petra Teeter 237121: Yeah.

1027
01:17:57.130 --> 01:17:58.045
Dolores Albarracin: 5 Year Plan.

1028
01:17:59.430 --> 01:18:02.400
Frank: You can check out, meet up to meet up.

1029
01:18:02.728 --> 01:18:05.689
Petra Teeter 237121: Have done in the past, but that was well

1030
01:18:06.040 --> 01:18:09.389
Petra Teeter 237121: in Texas, so I'm sure they have it in North Carolina.

1031
01:18:09.770 --> 01:18:10.500
Dolores Albarracin: Hey!

1032
01:18:10.500 --> 01:18:13.760
Petra Teeter 237121: Have you done that lately, Frank? Is that still safe?

1033
01:18:14.650 --> 01:18:28.290
Frank: It is. Yeah, I mean, I've I've done it. I've moved around quite a bit. So I use it kind of everywhere that I move to both for online stuff and in person. And I've never had any issues, safety.

1034
01:18:28.950 --> 01:18:29.335
Petra Teeter 237121: Okay.

1035
01:18:30.170 --> 01:18:31.900
Dolores Albarracin: And Morgan.

1036
01:18:31.900 --> 01:18:32.770
Morgan Potts: Yes, ma'am.

1037
01:18:32.770 --> 01:18:37.059
Dolores Albarracin: How about you? What would you like to do in the next 2 or 3 months?

1038
01:18:37.450 --> 01:18:40.200
Dolores Albarracin: Where are you? Gonna take your life to.

1039
01:18:42.720 --> 01:18:47.709
Morgan Potts: I need to get back into taking better care of my

1040
01:18:48.070 --> 01:18:51.339
Morgan Potts: stop putting everything ahead of me like

1041
01:18:51.450 --> 01:18:54.949
Morgan Potts: I got to clean the house, got to do laundry. I got to do this. Gotta do that.

1042
01:18:55.365 --> 01:19:01.569
Morgan Potts: I I need to get back into that and put myself as more of a priority

1043
01:19:01.740 --> 01:19:03.049
Morgan Potts: rather than what I did.

1044
01:19:04.103 --> 01:19:05.170
Dolores Albarracin: And I.

1045
01:19:05.640 --> 01:19:09.020
Dolores Albarracin: How do you do it? How do you make yourself a priority?

1046
01:19:11.080 --> 01:19:14.749
Morgan Potts: Put into perspective that those things can wait.

1047
01:19:15.020 --> 01:19:18.480
Morgan Potts: And you're not getting any younger baby. So.

1048
01:19:18.980 --> 01:19:20.230
Patricia Renaud: Go ahead and.

1049
01:19:20.950 --> 01:19:31.879
Morgan Potts: Do this and take care of you, and do everything else, and take care of the house or other people later, because you have to make yourself a priority, because nobody else is going to

1050
01:19:32.540 --> 01:19:36.270
Dolores Albarracin: That sounds really great. And the same time

1051
01:19:36.890 --> 01:19:39.880
Dolores Albarracin: it's a little bit difficult for me to picture.

1052
01:19:40.010 --> 01:19:46.379
Dolores Albarracin: So give me an example of something you haven't been doing that that you want to do to make

1053
01:19:48.170 --> 01:19:49.050
Dolores Albarracin: priority.

1054
01:19:49.410 --> 01:19:54.139
Morgan Potts: Yeah. So I I used to love to cook. And now that I live by myself.

1055
01:19:54.410 --> 01:19:59.029
Morgan Potts: I'm like, I don't want to mess up the kitchen. I'll just get takeout, you know.

1056
01:19:59.586 --> 01:20:04.459
Morgan Potts: I wanted to get back into cooking at least twice a week.

1057
01:20:04.680 --> 01:20:07.200
Dolores Albarracin: That would. That would be very.

1058
01:20:07.400 --> 01:20:10.500
Morgan Potts: Very good for me and my waistline and my budget.

1059
01:20:11.202 --> 01:20:15.710
Morgan Potts: So I need to get back on that. My, that is kind of like.

1060
01:20:16.040 --> 01:20:24.769
Morgan Potts: I don't like using the whole New Year's resolution clip, you know, Cliche, but that's something that I'm I'm going to really get back into.

1061
01:20:26.320 --> 01:20:29.110
Morgan Potts: Come, January, and.

1062
01:20:31.660 --> 01:20:36.740
Dolores Albarracin: Starting even in December, maybe with one meal that you cook at home.

1063
01:20:37.030 --> 01:20:38.130
Morgan Potts: Yeah, that's great.

1064
01:20:38.910 --> 01:20:43.899
Morgan Potts: That's great, at least once a week, and then, you know, just bump it up a little bit, instead of

1065
01:20:44.180 --> 01:20:47.840
Morgan Potts: you know, running to go grab thai food, or something like that.

1066
01:20:48.980 --> 01:20:52.809
Dolores Albarracin: Okay, I really like that idea. Any thoughts from the group.

1067
01:20:53.660 --> 01:20:57.320
john bianculli: Well, one minor thing that might be easier said than done, but

1068
01:20:57.450 --> 01:21:01.960
john bianculli: try to cut out sugared soda just by that.

1069
01:21:03.520 --> 01:21:07.600
john bianculli: and with your coffee. Try not to put heavy cream or things that are high calorie.

1070
01:21:08.150 --> 01:21:11.110
john bianculli: and I just try not to drink a calorie

1071
01:21:11.220 --> 01:21:13.529
john bianculli: or try not to drink something that's fattening.

1072
01:21:14.220 --> 01:21:15.740
Morgan Potts: Do my best. Yes, sir.

1073
01:21:15.920 --> 01:21:20.230
Dolores Albarracin: Yes, absolutely all right. This is

1074
01:21:21.480 --> 01:21:31.540
Dolores Albarracin: this, I wonder? The the meal a week that you cook for? You prioritize yourself.

1075
01:21:31.880 --> 01:21:33.880
Dolores Albarracin: What could go wrong.

1076
01:21:34.800 --> 01:21:43.269
Morgan Potts: Oh, I get home late, like I'm going to tonight because I have a work meeting, and I apologize for talking to you guys while I'm driving, but I didn't want to miss this

1077
01:21:44.010 --> 01:21:49.050
Morgan Potts: but like tonight, I've got a work meeting at 6 30,

1078
01:21:49.220 --> 01:21:53.890
Morgan Potts: so oh, well, it's too late to cook. I'll just grab something.

1079
01:21:55.530 --> 01:22:01.120
Morgan Potts: Yeah. Doing like the meal prep would be helpful. I used to do that pretty diligently.

1080
01:22:04.640 --> 01:22:10.300
Morgan Potts: So that would probably be the biggest thing. Taking it off the rails would be unexpected.

1081
01:22:10.660 --> 01:22:13.410
Morgan Potts: typical on atypical night.

1082
01:22:13.700 --> 01:22:18.439
Dolores Albarracin: Do you know the of these evening meetings ahead of time?

1083
01:22:19.160 --> 01:22:25.109
Morgan Potts: I do so I could. I could either eat before or eat after.

1084
01:22:25.380 --> 01:22:29.450
Morgan Potts: probably before would be smart, otherwise I'll get hangry during the meeting.

1085
01:22:30.340 --> 01:22:32.739
Dolores Albarracin: Yeah, or cook on another night

1086
01:22:32.830 --> 01:22:37.379
Dolores Albarracin: for that night when you have the meeting, so you can meet before the meeting.

1087
01:22:37.880 --> 01:22:38.660
Morgan Potts: Yes, ma'am.

1088
01:22:39.740 --> 01:22:44.760
Dolores Albarracin: Alright. So the next thing we have is, you know, you, you

1089
01:22:45.230 --> 01:22:52.799
Dolores Albarracin: mentioned this really strong interest to potentially meet. So I'd like for you to to be able to

1090
01:22:52.820 --> 01:22:56.690
Dolores Albarracin: make a little plan of that if you like.

1091
01:22:57.250 --> 01:23:01.700
Dolores Albarracin: Maybe for 1 1 meeting, how that would be, and

1092
01:23:02.160 --> 01:23:06.770
Dolores Albarracin: we'll definitely open the zoom room for you.

1093
01:23:07.320 --> 01:23:13.359
Dolores Albarracin: Okay, you'll you'll all have control. So tell me, when would you? Would you like to do it?

1094
01:23:14.070 --> 01:23:16.430
Dolores Albarracin: I'm open to? I'm open to the idea.

1095
01:23:18.980 --> 01:23:19.810
Dolores Albarracin: Others.

1096
01:23:21.460 --> 01:23:21.940
Frank: I know.

1097
01:23:22.210 --> 01:23:24.680
Lewis: Try to be available. Like.

1098
01:23:25.670 --> 01:23:28.789
Lewis: yeah, I was just gonna say that part.

1099
01:23:30.160 --> 01:23:31.210
Morgan Potts: I didn't hear.

1100
01:23:31.720 --> 01:23:35.829
john bianculli: If we could try to pick a weekend like a Saturday or a Sunday.

1101
01:23:36.661 --> 01:23:41.779
Morgan Potts: Sundays would be better. I'll do everything I can.

1102
01:23:43.190 --> 01:23:50.529
Morgan Potts: If not, if not, live like we're doing, you know, at least participate in the the Forum. So you know, I'll do everything I can.

1103
01:23:54.350 --> 01:23:55.540
Dolores Albarracin: How about others?

1104
01:23:57.110 --> 01:23:57.820
Patricia Renaud: Yes.

1105
01:23:58.165 --> 01:23:59.200
Petra Teeter 237121: Would be good.

1106
01:24:00.630 --> 01:24:13.589
Frank: Yeah, my the spiritual practice is in the evenings, but it's it's on Saturdays. So I don't have to. I have. I have Sundays generally available.

1107
01:24:14.260 --> 01:24:15.080
Frank: Yes.

1108
01:24:15.080 --> 01:24:22.200
Dolores Albarracin: Would you like to do it like this on on Zoom? Or do you want to do a phone call, or, what's better for all of you?

1109
01:24:24.339 --> 01:24:25.409
Frank: Either.

1110
01:24:26.180 --> 01:24:26.600
Frank: Fine.

1111
01:24:26.600 --> 01:24:27.060
john bianculli: And.

1112
01:24:27.440 --> 01:24:28.000
Frank: I mean.

1113
01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:32.439
john bianculli: And we could keep it to zoom. And if you don't want to share your video, you don't have to.

1114
01:24:32.640 --> 01:24:40.110
Frank: Yeah, I think that's fair, cause you can do zoom just audio like you don't have to turn your camera on if you don't feel like it.

1115
01:24:41.510 --> 01:24:48.570
john bianculli: Yeah, that's correct. Or if you use Microsoft teams, there's a number you can call in on with the group meeting if you don't want to use your cell phone.

1116
01:24:48.890 --> 01:24:56.179
Dolores Albarracin: Okay, so I'm gonna ask for for somebody to create a a zoom

1117
01:24:56.810 --> 01:25:01.000
Dolores Albarracin: Zoom Meeting sort of dedicated that you can reuse.

1118
01:25:01.870 --> 01:25:08.520
Dolores Albarracin: And and then you can decide. So when would you like to meet on Sunday?

1119
01:25:12.900 --> 01:25:19.480
john bianculli: Well, I mean we would probably maybe it would have to be either early in the mornings or in the evening.

1120
01:25:19.480 --> 01:25:20.150
Frank: Got you.

1121
01:25:20.150 --> 01:25:22.270
john bianculli: Afternoon. I think my conflict will charge.

1122
01:25:24.400 --> 01:25:28.689
john bianculli: because some people kind of worship like Saturday around or Sunday around noon.

1123
01:25:35.780 --> 01:25:37.070
Dolores Albarracin: So early morning, or.

1124
01:25:37.070 --> 01:25:39.779
john bianculli: Well, why don't we do? Why don't we do? Well.

1125
01:25:39.880 --> 01:25:43.900
john bianculli: don't forget. I mean, Sunday is like your day of rest in your day to sleep in.

1126
01:25:44.680 --> 01:25:49.170
john bianculli: so maybe I don't know. Let's throw a time out there, and let's see how it goes.

1127
01:25:49.280 --> 01:25:51.379
john bianculli: Sunday at 3 o'clock.

1128
01:25:55.240 --> 01:26:00.309
Lewis: I'm available for anything after afternoons on after like 12.

1129
01:26:00.410 --> 01:26:01.440
Frank: Thank you. Yeah.

1130
01:26:01.440 --> 01:26:03.579
Frank: Yeah. Early morning is a good work for me.

1131
01:26:04.020 --> 01:26:04.420
Patricia Renaud: No.

1132
01:26:04.420 --> 01:26:04.890
john bianculli: So how many.

1133
01:26:04.890 --> 01:26:06.190
Lewis: Yeah, that might not work.

1134
01:26:06.590 --> 01:26:08.220
Dolores Albarracin: 3 o'clock on Sunday.

1135
01:26:08.780 --> 01:26:09.260
Frank: Universal.

1136
01:26:09.260 --> 01:26:13.550
john bianculli: I mean, it's not exactly dinner time, so it shouldn't affect meals.

1137
01:26:13.850 --> 01:26:15.520
Dolores Albarracin: Are you all on Eastern time?

1138
01:26:16.650 --> 01:26:22.040
john bianculli: Well, I'm gonna be on Eastern Standard time on on Friday.

1139
01:26:22.040 --> 01:26:23.040
john bianculli: Yeah.

1140
01:26:23.040 --> 01:26:25.600
john bianculli: Friday. I'll be back to Eastern Standard.

1141
01:26:25.600 --> 01:26:27.159
Frank: I'm Eastern as well.

1142
01:26:27.320 --> 01:26:32.290
Dolores Albarracin: We'll create. We'll create the zoom zoom room and send it to all of you.

1143
01:26:32.780 --> 01:26:33.810
Dolores Albarracin: And

1144
01:26:33.820 --> 01:26:42.899
Dolores Albarracin: the other thing is, if you want to keep connecting. You probably want to exchange your information, or or I mean, just tell me to

1145
01:26:43.110 --> 01:26:48.640
Dolores Albarracin: share your contact information, or what to share with others, so you can communicate.

1146
01:26:49.320 --> 01:26:51.520
Dolores Albarracin: Do you communicate via email.

1147
01:26:52.650 --> 01:26:56.210
john bianculli: Okay, so how about this? Why don't we say, do a roll call?

1148
01:26:56.420 --> 01:27:00.619
john bianculli: Who finds it acceptable to share their email? Is that a good way of doing it.

1149
01:27:01.960 --> 01:27:05.259
john bianculli: So I mean, yes, to sharing my email. That's fine with the group.

1176
01:29:04.470 --> 01:29:23.470
Lewis: I would just say I'm appreciative for all the positivity each week. You know, I need a refresh on positivity because a lot of times. I look at stuff, you know, half empty and half half full, and don't think that anything's gonna go right for me. So I appreciate positivity when I, when when we've met, I appreciate meeting you guys.

1177
01:29:25.250 --> 01:29:26.050

1181
01:29:41.900 --> 01:29:46.730
john bianculli: you communicate. If you have a minor failure, don't make it a total. Armageddon.

1182
01:29:48.460 --> 01:29:50.460
Dolores Albarracin: Wonderful and frank.

1183
01:29:50.770 --> 01:30:17.779
Frank: Yeah, I think it was just I appreciate everyone being here and I I think it's been good to kind of get insight from from other people. That may not be, you know. May have addiction issues or may not, or may have, you know, like pain issues or everybody's kind of got their own thing going on. But we're all able to to collaborate and offer each other offer input. Into things. And I've just enjoyed that.

1184
01:30:19.050 --> 01:30:31.449
