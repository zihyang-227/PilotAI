5
00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:11.430
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: is everything in Ohio the same way.

6
00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:11.980
Matthew Warner: Knowing.

7
00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:14.529

Gina Knepp: And so.

11
00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:24.000
Matthew Warner: Probably.

12
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:24.550
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: Maybe

13
00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.290
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: in Kansas is not snowing. It is just very cold. It's just cold right now. So.

14
00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:37.060
Matthew Warner: Right. I lived in Coffeeville for a few years.

15
00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:38.000
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: Oh, really.

16
00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:41.630
Matthew Warner: Hmm!

17
00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:46.900
Matthew Warner: I always thought it was kind of morbid that they celebrate killing 4 people every year.

18
00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:48.680
Gina Knepp: No.

19
00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:49.655
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: Oh, yeah, they

20
00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.799
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: What is it? The I wanna say, Dalton gang? But I'm no what? What?

21
00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:56.780
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: Okay?

22
00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:57.980
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: Okay? Okay.

23
00:00:57.980 --> 00:00:59.060
Matthew Warner: It's the Dalton game.

24
00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:09.240
Matthew Warner: So yeah, I mean, it was kind of morbid that they react that every year town that celebrates murder.

25
00:01:10.513 --> 00:01:11.460
Matthew Warner: If you.

26
00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:16.930
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: If you go up to Colorado they have a lot of those like

27
00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:22.600
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: gunfights, those famous gunfights. They re reenact a lot of those and

28
00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:27.720
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: Colorado and up into South Dakota as well, seems to be a a thing.

29
00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:29.950
Matthew Warner: Right.

30
00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.659

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:17.000
Stacey Ford: So.

68
00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:18.359
Matthew Warner: It was. It was good.

69
00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:28.389
Matthew Warner: We agree. We we laugh at each other more than we done anything at our age, right

70
00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:31.069
Matthew Warner: and our age, trying to play a game.

71
00:04:32.565 --> 00:04:33.670
Stacey Ford: Courses.

72
00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:35.455
Stacey Ford: There, there's someone's

73
00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:38.449
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: Noise in the background.

74
00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:40.570
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: I don't know if it's Gina or Stacy. If you're.

75
00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:43.060
Stacey Ford: My thought is muted.

76
00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:44.850
Gina Knepp: It shouldn't be me.

77
00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:49.589
Matthew Warner: Frank, it's me I'm in the room with the door shut.

78
00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:54.560
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: Okay, all right. Thanks, Stacy. Well, that's great to hear.

79
00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:59.360
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: Matthew. So every Friday night is game night now.

80
00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:01.350
Matthew Warner: Yes.

81
00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:02.536
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: Yeah, and

82
00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:05.090
Matthew Warner: We're gonna have dinner together and then play game.

83
00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:08.210
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: And so who's all? Who's all involved in this.

84
00:05:09.055 --> 00:05:12.210
Matthew Warner: Me and my woman and my dad and my stepmom

85
00:05:12.808 --> 00:05:17.680
Matthew Warner: so far, what my sister and her son is going to try this week.

86
00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:23.210
Matthew Warner: So, but it was. It was. It was great, you know. That's

87
00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:25.349
Matthew Warner: one of the 1st times that we all

88
00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:27.850
Matthew Warner: sit down and done anything together like that.

89
00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:32.589
Matthew Warner: and and I have to attribute it to our sobriety

90
00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:34.720
Matthew Warner: because we would have never done that.

91
00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:36.650
Matthew Warner: Anything like that, you know.

92
00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:38.170
Matthew Warner: So.

93
00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:40.559
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: Well, that's.

94
00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:42.350
Matthew Warner: We just keep getting better and better.

95
00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:46.620
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: Because the 1st time you connected was back Thanksgiving right?

96
00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:49.100
Matthew Warner: Right.

97
00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:49.690
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: Right.

98
00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:56.579
Matthew Warner: That's the 1st holiday we spent. That we had anything to do with each other actually was, was Thanksgiving.

99
00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:03.169
Matthew Warner: So it just keeps you getting better, you know I don't want to be.

100
00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:06.180
Matthew Warner: I don't want to be a pessimist, but but

101
00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:14.220
Matthew Warner: it it kind of scares me sometimes that things are going. Well, it's kind of like I'm waiting for the other shoe to drop, just to be honest sometimes.

102
00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:16.750
Matthew Warner: Yeah, because I mean.

103
00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:22.330
Matthew Warner: it can't be this easy, or maybe it can. I mean, this is all new to me at 50 years old. So

104
00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:24.439
Matthew Warner: maybe it does get easier.

105
00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:29.610
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: So what what other shoe are you afraid that? What are, what are.

106
00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:31.439
Matthew Warner: Or just something, you know.

107
00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:41.620
Matthew Warner: like just something bad. I don't know like it's been too good, and it's like the universe, you know. I am a pessimist. My woman says I'm a pessimist.

108
00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:46.090
Matthew Warner: you know, because I look at the cuff empty most of the time, she says.

109
00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:52.570
Matthew Warner: But if you, if if I expect everything the worst, then

110
00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:56.160
Matthew Warner: anything that happens that then it's good, you know.

111
00:06:58.410 --> 00:07:03.109
Matthew Warner: So you know, maybe that ain't a good way to be.

112
00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:08.520
Matthew Warner: But or maybe things just are getting better, you know.

113
00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:14.050
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: So did you all primarily interact around the game? Or did you have the chance to

114
00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:17.709
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: talk about anything else, re-reflect about.

115
00:07:17.710 --> 00:07:19.560
Matthew Warner: I'm just primarily the game.

116
00:07:19.790 --> 00:07:22.380
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: Primarily the game we played trivial pursuit.

117
00:07:22.830 --> 00:07:29.230
Matthew Warner: And and well, I hung my dad's Christmas lights, too, before the game.

118
00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:37.580
Matthew Warner: and you know he's 75. My stepmom is is 68, I believe so.

119
00:07:38.510 --> 00:07:39.410
Matthew Warner: You know

120
00:07:40.180 --> 00:07:44.749
Matthew Warner: anything I can do for him, because, you know, this is the 1st time I've ever been sober

121
00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:49.120
Matthew Warner: that I can remember since I was 15, you know.

122
00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:53.360
Matthew Warner: Well, Matt, that's M.

123
00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:55.650
Matthew Warner: Yeah.

124
00:07:55.730 --> 00:07:56.739
Matthew Warner: I like it.

125
00:07:57.050 --> 00:07:57.600
Matthew Warner: So.

126
00:07:58.320 --> 00:07:59.100
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: And congratulations.

127
00:07:59.100 --> 00:08:00.759
Matthew Warner: I like it better than using drugs.

128
00:08:02.410 --> 00:08:02.980
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: Well, congratulations!

129
00:08:02.980 --> 00:08:04.110

156
00:09:41.650 --> 00:09:45.119
Gina Knepp: But it's not really that new new, but I mean.

157
00:09:45.170 --> 00:09:47.160
Gina Knepp: maybe in the last year or 2.

158
00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:50.950
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: So what looks different in your

159
00:09:51.310 --> 00:09:57.440
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: if if we rewind 2 weeks ago and we were here today? What looks different for you, what?

160
00:09:57.810 --> 00:09:58.350
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: What's.

00:09:58.350 --> 00:10:01.491
Gina Knepp: Oh, my boyfriend, he's got a job

162
00:10:02.310 --> 00:10:08.449
Gina Knepp: that so that there's something that is really different for me. I mean money coming in now, and

163
00:10:09.900 --> 00:10:14.860
Gina Knepp: that's not like, well, we're getting along better, since we're not always together. So

164
00:10:15.340 --> 00:10:18.690
Gina Knepp: that would be the main thing, looking different.

165
00:10:19.810 --> 00:10:25.679
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: And you had mentioned during our our last time, together issues with anxiety. How?

166
00:10:25.900 --> 00:10:28.679
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: How is that? How has that been over the last couple of weeks?

167
00:10:30.153 --> 00:10:31.439
Gina Knepp: Still pretty.

168
00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:41.040
Gina Knepp: I still, I'm I still get anxiety pretty bad. I have twin boys at 2 years old, and a girl a little girl 3. So you can only imagine

169
00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:44.559
Gina Knepp: how that is like every day. Well, just every day, just

170
00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:50.480
Gina Knepp: like it's stressful. Some days, I mean, it's there's good that comes out of each day, of course, but

171
00:10:50.690 --> 00:10:57.360
Gina Knepp: I know, like my I don't know. I get stressed out and fair enough.

172
00:10:58.430 --> 00:11:01.810
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: Any as a result of the.

173
00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:07.779
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: Is there anything I don't want to say negative. But any barriers that you're experiencing because of

174
00:11:08.140 --> 00:11:09.790
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: your anxiety right now.

175
00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:17.549
Gina Knepp: More. It'd be like more personal between me and my boyfriend. But

176
00:11:18.290 --> 00:11:21.490
Gina Knepp: I don't know. Like sex issues. Maybe

177
00:11:21.710 --> 00:11:24.849
Gina Knepp: the anxiety part like being able to be myself.

178
00:11:24.970 --> 00:11:25.850
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: Okay.

179
00:11:26.980 --> 00:11:33.020
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: And and did you find you mentioned the game night specifically? Was there anything about that?

180

185
00:11:47.710 --> 00:11:48.690
Stacey Ford: M.

186
00:11:48.850 --> 00:11:54.460
Gina Knepp: Like being around family like it brings me. It makes me more relaxed and less stressed and

187
00:11:56.050 --> 00:11:58.740
Gina Knepp: loved. Maybe I guess I don't know.

188
00:12:01.060 --> 00:12:03.210

191
00:12:14.912 --> 00:12:15.640
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: really? Well for you.

192
00:12:15.640 --> 00:12:16.969
Stacey Ford: Less than 1,512.

193
00:12:16.970 --> 00:12:18.700
Gina Knepp: No, not really.

194
00:12:18.920 --> 00:12:19.739
Stacey Ford: That sounds good.

195
00:12:19.740 --> 00:12:22.230
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: Yeah, well, we'll we'll talk about

196
00:12:22.840 --> 00:12:24.800
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: the purpose of today's meeting will be growing

197
00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:28.710
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: beyond our our meetings here, and so we'll have the chance to

198
00:12:29.102 --> 00:12:33.637
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: take a deeper dive to deeper. Dive into that in a little bit. Here, Gina.

199
00:12:34.500 --> 00:12:36.940
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: before they want to check in with the rest of the group.

200
00:12:37.140 --> 00:12:39.219
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: Ravetra, how was? How was your week?

201
00:12:49.010 --> 00:12:50.580
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: Oh, you're still on mute! There you go.

202
00:12:50.580 --> 00:12:51.340
Ravettra Ford: There we go.

203
00:12:53.600 --> 00:13:00.930
Ravettra Ford: Basically. My joints and everything started hurting me.

204
00:13:02.530 --> 00:13:07.819
Ravettra Ford: As I I can't remember. I think I probably shared with you that my mom's

205
00:13:07.950 --> 00:13:15.880
Ravettra Ford: boyfriend asked if I had gout, and I told him no, not that I had knowledge of. I only had

206
00:13:16.030 --> 00:13:21.379
Ravettra Ford: my Lcl. Arthritis and my diabetic neuropathy, that I had

207
00:13:21.450 --> 00:13:29.969
Ravettra Ford: my prescription drugs for which, with the osteoarthritis which I had doubling up on

208
00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:37.374
Ravettra Ford: my prescription of the ibuprofen that I have been prescribed. So

209
00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:43.309
Ravettra Ford: I basically my medically wise.

210
00:13:43.970 --> 00:13:49.899
Ravettra Ford: I I was just discharged on last Tuesday.

211
00:13:50.970 --> 00:13:59.970
Ravettra Ford: so I've been in a hospital and I haven't

212
00:14:00.150 --> 00:14:08.130
Ravettra Ford: been able to. Well, I haven't gotten a follow up, I should say, with my medical provider, because.

213
00:14:08.310 --> 00:14:21.180
Ravettra Ford: according to the receptionist who took my call. I expressed to her that my discharge nurse went over my paperwork with me, and expressed that

214
00:14:21.320 --> 00:14:28.100
Ravettra Ford: I needed to get in to see my medical provider. In one week

215
00:14:28.180 --> 00:14:34.579
Ravettra Ford: she expressed that their policy they don't do one week they do 2,

216
00:14:34.630 --> 00:14:41.510
Ravettra Ford: so therefore I don't go in to see my medical provider until the 6th T.

217
00:14:42.610 --> 00:14:52.900
Ravettra Ford: However, I did express to them that the medication, since they diagnosed me with gout.

218
00:14:54.990 --> 00:15:21.610
Ravettra Ford: I was going to be totally out. I didn't have any refills. So what they did was went ahead and wrote me enough of a prescription to extend so I could have that, at least until they were able to see me for my upcoming visit, and I wouldn't be in the excruciating pain.

219
00:15:21.830 --> 00:15:24.189
Ravettra Ford: the unbearable pain.

220
00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:27.560
Ravettra Ford: So my hand

221
00:15:27.650 --> 00:15:43.249
Ravettra Ford: it like really like, swelled up to what like I, my mom and I call like the nutty Professor Hand. I'm not for sure you've seen that movie or not. So it's very. It's still tender to the touch. I can't

222
00:15:43.930 --> 00:15:49.700
Ravettra Ford: bow my hand, my fingers up 2 of this.

223
00:15:50.370 --> 00:15:53.820
Ravettra Ford: and I can't really like grasp

224
00:15:54.887 --> 00:16:07.569
Ravettra Ford: much. If anything, I try to my doctors say the more that I do the better that it will get eventually get stronger.

225
00:16:07.580 --> 00:16:10.750
Ravettra Ford: Before I left the hospital.

226
00:16:11.838 --> 00:16:17.599
Ravettra Ford: The doctors were saying they were going to try to get an occupational therapist to come by.

227
00:16:17.900 --> 00:16:25.989
Ravettra Ford: However, I don't know what happened with that part of the process, because no one ever showed up.

228
00:16:26.150 --> 00:16:30.610
Ravettra Ford: So I suppose maybe I'll ask my medical provider

229
00:16:30.780 --> 00:16:38.360
Ravettra Ford: once I am seen by him on Monday, the 16, th so.

230
00:16:38.700 --> 00:16:44.869
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: Were you able to? I I know, when we visited about this last week, you were trying to

231
00:16:46.140 --> 00:16:49.210
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: essentially get back to taking the prescription.

232
00:16:50.840 --> 00:16:53.120
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: like it was prescribed. Is that right?

233
00:16:53.930 --> 00:16:57.340
Ravettra Ford: And okay. Yes, I will say that

234
00:16:58.020 --> 00:17:07.260
Ravettra Ford: I'm proud of myself. I haven't been doubling up as it is prescribed.

235
00:17:08.319 --> 00:17:11.109
Ravettra Ford: so that is the best of mine.

236
00:17:11.589 --> 00:17:12.939
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: And have there been any?

237
00:17:13.259 --> 00:17:15.249
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: What? What's been the outcome of that.

238
00:17:17.510 --> 00:17:19.356
Ravettra Ford: I'm still

239
00:17:20.690 --> 00:17:24.400
Ravettra Ford: I want to say that.

240
00:17:24.781 --> 00:17:27.010
Ravettra Ford: I'm proud of myself for that.

241
00:17:27.140 --> 00:17:36.910
Ravettra Ford: However, I'm still experiencing the pain with the gout, because I know that any type of drug has

242
00:17:38.800 --> 00:17:50.169
Ravettra Ford: it's time to work with this, and within your system it has to get equally balanced, I should say.

243
00:17:50.450 --> 00:18:03.819
Ravettra Ford: with like all of your other medications, and your bodily systems and organs, and everything and all of that has to work together. It takes some time.

244
00:18:04.040 --> 00:18:09.230
Ravettra Ford: So I know that it's gonna take some time. So

245
00:18:09.340 --> 00:18:12.890
Ravettra Ford: I'm I'm just being patient about it.

246
00:18:14.234 --> 00:18:18.730
Ravettra Ford: It makes me want to start doing it again. But I'm not.

247
00:18:19.210 --> 00:18:28.379
Ravettra Ford: I'm just holding steady, holding strong keeping with the way that all of my

248
00:18:30.950 --> 00:18:38.599
Ravettra Ford: directions are as prescribed as my doctors have it on the bottle and just leaving it like that.

249
00:18:39.140 --> 00:18:47.520
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: Do you have any resources or support that you've been able to turn to to help you in this time until you can see your doctor

250
00:18:47.890 --> 00:18:48.999
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: on the 16.th

251
00:18:50.170 --> 00:18:55.649
Ravettra Ford: I do. I talk to my mom daily.

252
00:18:56.490 --> 00:19:00.009
Ravettra Ford: She and I are really close. We're like sisters.

253
00:19:00.570 --> 00:19:05.480
Ravettra Ford: and also I talk. I talk to my children

254
00:19:05.570 --> 00:19:09.969
Ravettra Ford: daily as well joke around with them.

255
00:19:11.520 --> 00:19:16.120
Ravettra Ford: So and I have a friend that I talked to.

256
00:19:16.160 --> 00:19:23.120
Ravettra Ford: but everyone pretty much kind of check on me to ask me, how how am I doing?

257
00:19:24.794 --> 00:19:30.009
Ravettra Ford: As far as that is concerned, the thing about it?

258
00:19:30.250 --> 00:19:33.990
Ravettra Ford: Not all of them. They didn't know

259
00:19:34.210 --> 00:19:37.779
Ravettra Ford: my mom. She was probably the only one

260
00:19:37.840 --> 00:19:40.759
Ravettra Ford: that knew that I was doubling up

261
00:19:41.860 --> 00:19:52.069
Ravettra Ford: on the medication on the profan. That prescription they didn't know per se, but they really, but they would check on me just

262
00:19:53.210 --> 00:20:00.899
Ravettra Ford: overall to see how I was doing health wise in my recovery process.

263
00:20:01.380 --> 00:20:02.130
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: Okay?

264
00:20:02.360 --> 00:20:04.742
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: Well, as we put a PIN in that

00:20:54.070 --> 00:21:04.629
Stacey Ford: had a really crappy week, but also a lot of good through it. And it depends. If what

278
00:21:04.650 --> 00:21:07.609
Stacey Ford: you know the the priority

279
00:21:07.640 --> 00:21:14.079
Stacey Ford: goal or whatnot being me and my daughter, or whatnot, or me and my brother.

280
00:21:14.100 --> 00:21:24.269
Stacey Ford: my brother is sitting at home. He his life was saved, and he's home from the hospital. So that makes me very happy.

281
00:21:24.758 --> 00:21:48.660
Stacey Ford: They did find out the diagnosis that it was, and I could send it to you. It's very interesting. And had he not made it to the hospital that night, he would have passed because the it would have invaded his diaphragm, and then paralysis and death within

282
00:21:48.900 --> 00:21:50.110
Stacey Ford: powers.

283
00:21:50.600 --> 00:21:53.779
Stacey Ford: So with that being said

284
00:21:55.122 --> 00:22:07.930
Stacey Ford: I've just been trying, you know, catching up with my family and my my girlfriends. A little bit to the point where I I am

285
00:22:08.380 --> 00:22:21.219
Stacey Ford: letting everyone know my what my plan is, and what I am focusing on. And I haven't. I have really. I honestly haven't done much, and I feel horrible.

286
00:22:21.270 --> 00:22:24.370
Stacey Ford: But I'm I'm in that direction.

287
00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:26.350
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: Were there.

288
00:22:26.350 --> 00:22:27.150
Stacey Ford: And.

289
00:22:27.150 --> 00:22:33.610
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: Were there any bright spots I know you mentioned wanting to carve some time away for for yourself, and that might be through

290
00:22:33.670 --> 00:22:36.270
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: going to church with your sister, or.

291
00:22:36.420 --> 00:22:36.960
Stacey Ford: My

292
00:22:36.960 --> 00:22:57.309
Stacey Ford: my sister is actually driving to Missouri. I'm in Chicago right now, currently, and excuse me. So we did not go to church. But yes, I did speak to her, and of course we are. And when so I I'm gonna miss the sessions, I really am. And I'm gonna miss hearing everyone else's

293
00:22:57.340 --> 00:23:00.070
Stacey Ford: stuff going on in their lives. And

294
00:23:02.270 --> 00:23:03.540
Stacey Ford: I really am.

295
00:23:05.130 --> 00:23:15.390
Stacey Ford: But yes, I I spoke to my excuse me. My brother, who is home from the hospital now, which that's

296
00:23:15.580 --> 00:23:21.620
Stacey Ford: that's 3 to 4 h we could talk minimum. I mean

297
00:23:22.284 --> 00:23:29.105
Stacey Ford: but everything right now is great. And and I'm gonna see y'all.

298
00:23:30.650 --> 00:23:33.940
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: What are what are some ways that you took care of yourself throughout the week.

299
00:23:33.940 --> 00:23:36.269
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: that you've had some time just to focus on you.

300
00:23:36.630 --> 00:23:37.190
Stacey Ford: Okay.

301
00:23:46.250 --> 00:23:52.920
Stacey Ford: I have nothing to complain about right there, I mean, honestly, truly, and not

302
00:23:52.980 --> 00:23:57.280
Stacey Ford: I'm already. I spoiled myself already. I I

303
00:23:57.590 --> 00:24:03.409
Stacey Ford: I just right now. I don't have. I can't do that right now. I can't.

304
00:24:03.790 --> 00:24:09.799
Stacey Ford: I can't and I'm gonna be back in Florida. I'm I'm looking

305
00:24:13.010 --> 00:24:17.030
Stacey Ford: I do not have an Illinois driver's license.

306
00:24:17.050 --> 00:24:22.699
Stacey Ford: and I do have a Florida, but I am looking to

307
00:24:24.390 --> 00:24:35.599
Stacey Ford: drive back with my belongings and my 2 little Pomeranians, and into my beautiful hermit on the beach footage which I already have

308
00:24:35.750 --> 00:24:41.680
Stacey Ford: in the next month, and I'm working on that, too, as well. So

309
00:24:42.634 --> 00:24:55.279
Stacey Ford: what I'm doing for myself is all those things. And talking to other people? I actually have a psychiatrist that

310
00:24:55.280 --> 00:25:12.630
Stacey Ford: I don't know if I mentioned that or not a few weeks ago. Excuse me, here's something. Here's a great resource to record, or let other people that might be in the Jacksonville, Jacksonville, Florida area. It's called Mass Muslims.

311
00:25:12.680 --> 00:25:16.259
Stacey Ford: American Muslim, American Social Services,

312
00:25:17.400 --> 00:25:29.909
Stacey Ford: and I can send you the email and the street address and all that. But they provide health care for anybody, with no insurance under insurance or

313
00:25:30.380 --> 00:25:39.520
Stacey Ford: no insurance, one or the other, and they are trying to get back to our country for allowing that us to have them here

314
00:25:39.740 --> 00:25:49.349
Stacey Ford: and again, I can provide all the information regarding the phone number, and that's they. It blows my mind. They have taken care of me.

315
00:25:49.853 --> 00:25:56.929
Stacey Ford: And they still are. They're doing it all through zoom appointments. And they just gave me a psychiatrist

316
00:25:57.320 --> 00:26:01.509
Stacey Ford: and and they're just trying to get back to our country.

317
00:26:02.920 --> 00:26:06.019
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: When was the last time you met with your psychiatrist?

318
00:26:06.020 --> 00:26:07.639
Stacey Ford: Yesterday yesterday

319
00:26:07.730 --> 00:26:18.817
Stacey Ford: yesterday, and then I suppose it was 2 weeks ago. They're setting me up with them, and the mental care and whatnot

320
00:26:20.130 --> 00:26:24.620
Stacey Ford: and I have nothing but great positive things to say about that.

321
00:26:25.280 --> 00:26:28.889
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: Well, that that sounds great, Stacy. It sounds like you had a positive week.

322
00:26:29.460 --> 00:26:31.579
Stacey Ford: In that regard. So that's good.

323
00:26:32.690 --> 00:26:39.559
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: Again. We'll talk about those longer range plans here in a little bit. But before we do that, Shannon, how was? How was your week.

324
00:26:40.730 --> 00:26:42.110
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: Can you talk? Okay.

325
00:26:49.950 --> 00:26:50.783
Stacey Ford: That day.

326
00:26:53.590 --> 00:26:58.279
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: You're still on mute, I know, on a cell phone. Sometimes it's hard. There you go.

327
00:26:58.730 --> 00:27:00.940
Shannon: Alright, yeah. Sorry about that.

328
00:27:00.940 --> 00:27:01.589
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: How was your week?

329
00:27:01.590 --> 00:27:02.380
Shannon: It's been,

330
00:27:04.333 --> 00:27:11.640
Shannon: It's okay. I guess I'm, alive, but I don't know,

331
00:27:14.530 --> 00:27:21.560
Shannon: really, i've just been kind of busy like so packing up things and my

332
00:27:22.330 --> 00:27:24.061
Shannon: or our new tenant that we

333
00:27:24.790 --> 00:27:28.189
Shannon: we decided to let stay with us. She's like

334
00:27:28.980 --> 00:27:34.770
Shannon: crazy, and it's just like a big mistake that we ever let her move in. So it's kinda

335
00:27:35.730 --> 00:27:37.589
Shannon: difficult with that.

336
00:27:39.480 --> 00:27:42.343
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: So one thing we had talked about last week is

337
00:27:43.080 --> 00:27:49.040
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: Maybe you reaching or trying to find some additional support, whether

338
00:27:49.840 --> 00:27:52.500
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: whatever that looked like for you. How did how did that.

339
00:27:55.730 --> 00:28:00.850
Shannon: Well, I didn't really get a chance to do the do much of that.

340
00:28:02.998 --> 00:28:04.830
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: Are, are you okay?

341
00:28:05.690 --> 00:28:06.629
Shannon: Yeah, I'm fine.

342
00:28:06.840 --> 00:28:09.240
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: Okay, are are you driving right now?

343
00:28:09.780 --> 00:28:11.809
Shannon: No, I'm I'm in the passenger side.

344
00:28:11.810 --> 00:28:15.709
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: Okay? Alright. So so you're in a safe environment to talk.

345
00:28:16.280 --> 00:28:18.610
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: Yeah, yeah, okay,

346
00:28:20.720 --> 00:28:23.700
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: So what about any any bright spots this week?

347
00:28:24.030 --> 00:28:26.200
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: Were there there any bright spots for you?

348
00:28:33.110 --> 00:28:35.080
Shannon: No, not really.

349
00:28:35.090 --> 00:28:36.550
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: Unfortunately.

350
00:28:41.250 --> 00:28:43.009
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: How? How are you feeling right now?

351
00:28:49.320 --> 00:28:55.990
Shannon: I'm I'm doing okay. I I feel fine. Still.

352
00:28:59.820 --> 00:29:01.840
Shannon: heck! I don't really know what to say.

353
00:29:08.980 --> 00:29:13.459
Shannon: Oh, I'm sorry. I I don't wanna say.

354
00:29:13.760 --> 00:29:17.760
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: Okay, all right. Well, we're gonna

355
00:29:17.760 --> 00:29:26.729
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: I have a question. I understand, Shannon, that you don't know what to say. But is there anything that.

356
00:29:27.260 --> 00:29:41.539
Stacey Ford: Is any of us could do to help you? Is there something that anyone could do to help you? For, for example, me like, what is. Can I help you? I don't know where you're located or whatnot.

357
00:29:41.720 --> 00:29:46.090
Stacey Ford: but I'm very resourceful. I know a lot of people, and

358
00:29:46.140 --> 00:29:50.639
Stacey Ford: I'm curious. If you need help then.

359
00:29:51.720 --> 00:29:55.089
Stacey Ford: Yeah, I don't know your location and whatnot, but.

360
00:29:56.470 --> 00:29:59.029
Shannon: Yeah, I live. I live in Tennessee.

361
00:29:59.210 --> 00:29:59.820
Stacey Ford: There you go!

362
00:30:02.190 --> 00:30:08.840
Shannon: I I don't. Let's see, I'm sorry I it's just kind of hard for me to talk in the car. I really wanted to

363
00:30:08.930 --> 00:30:13.039
Shannon: stop by and speak, go over to my mother-in-law's house and

364
00:30:13.200 --> 00:30:16.580
Shannon: and talk. It's just kind of has me to talk so. But.

365
00:30:16.580 --> 00:30:17.609
Stacey Ford: Doing, great.

366
00:30:20.450 --> 00:30:22.310
Shannon: But if let's see.

367
00:30:23.530 --> 00:30:24.840
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: And Stacey raises.

368
00:30:24.840 --> 00:30:26.450
Shannon: You know I appreciate your.

369
00:30:28.520 --> 00:30:32.129
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: Yeah, Stacey actually has that. That's a really good question, like, what

370
00:30:32.200 --> 00:30:34.029
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: what do you need right now? What?

00:30:42.620 --> 00:30:51.630
Shannon: Well, like everything. My life is just crazy right now.

374
00:30:52.150 --> 00:30:53.423
Shannon: It's just

375
00:30:56.360 --> 00:31:02.559
Shannon: I've just been like, really stressed out, especially yesterday, I think, and today.

376
00:31:02.800 --> 00:31:04.880
Shannon: but I think I'm doing a little bit better now.

377
00:31:09.490 --> 00:31:14.349
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: Are you going to be in an in an environment where you are safe?

Shannon: my phone just keeps like dropping a meeting.

389
00:32:16.380 --> 00:32:18.650

390
00:32:18.650 --> 00:32:25.670
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: That's okay. We're. We're going to transition into talking about

391
00:32:25.760 --> 00:32:32.929
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: our growth beyond these meetings and what that looks like for us individually, Shannon. If you

392
00:32:33.900 --> 00:32:40.209
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: need to reach out to Lena or I individually, please

395
00:32:46.700 --> 00:32:52.640
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: All right. So we're going to transition this conversation into

396
00:32:52.650 --> 00:32:57.409
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: our plans beyond today. So the goals that we've been working on and

397
00:32:57.580 --> 00:33:05.587
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: and what that might look like if we were to get together 3 months from now, where would we be? What would we? What would we look like? What would we be doing?

398
00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:07.770
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: And so I just want to open.

399
00:33:08.120 --> 00:33:10.560
Stacey Ford: Sort of that scenario up to all of you.

400
00:33:11.870 --> 00:33:17.270
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: What does growth look like from here? As we move forward from today?

401
00:33:17.757 --> 00:33:21.570
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: What does that look like? Specifically for you? And anyone can start.

402
00:33:24.930 --> 00:33:26.350
Matthew Warner: Minus sobriety.

403
00:33:27.200 --> 00:33:27.870
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: Okay.

404
00:33:27.870 --> 00:33:36.230
Matthew Warner: And know that I have one day at a time. So I'm not planning that far ahead. But but in 3 months from now I wanna have that

405
00:33:36.290 --> 00:33:40.010
Matthew Warner: still be able to say that if we was to talk that I'm still sober

406
00:33:40.110 --> 00:33:47.379
Matthew Warner: and I'm still drug free, you know. That's my ultimate goal, my long term goal.

407
00:33:49.060 --> 00:33:55.560
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: Now you started some really neat, short term ideas, game, night being

408
00:33:55.790 --> 00:33:59.050
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: a big, short term step, reconnecting with family

409
00:33:59.140 --> 00:34:02.080
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: any other any other thoughts. Matt, on.

410
00:34:02.550 --> 00:34:04.870
Stacey Ford: Any other experiments that you might try.

411
00:34:08.800 --> 00:34:11.927
Matthew Warner: I really don't know right yet. I mean there's only

412
00:34:12.389 --> 00:34:21.770
Matthew Warner: I would like to get my sister involved more and and help her if I could.

413
00:34:22.789 --> 00:34:28.580
Matthew Warner: My main goal is just not honestly, is just me and my girl, and what we can do from here.

414
00:34:31.520 --> 00:34:36.840
Matthew Warner: I would like actually, to tell you the truth, I would like to be moved away from where I'm at

415
00:34:37.360 --> 00:34:42.510
Matthew Warner: in 3 months from now, and and us buy a house.

416
00:34:43.400 --> 00:34:49.060
Stacey Ford: So we'll start working on that versus double check.

417
00:34:50.889 --> 00:34:51.299
Matthew Warner: You know.

418
00:34:53.429 --> 00:34:54.569
Matthew Warner: Baby steps.

419
00:34:56.909 --> 00:34:57.189
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: So

420
00:34:57.470 --> 00:34:57.790
Matthew Warner: But.

421
00:34:57.790 --> 00:34:58.279
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: Talk, about.

422
00:34:58.280 --> 00:34:58.900
Matthew Warner: 100.

423
00:35:00.470 --> 00:35:01.060
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: Talk, about.

424
00:35:01.060 --> 00:35:01.440
Matthew Warner: Go ahead!

425
00:35:01.550 --> 00:35:03.830
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: Now, what type of besides the

426
00:35:04.010 --> 00:35:08.712
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: the really strong environment you're creating with your your parents and

427
00:35:09.590 --> 00:35:13.359
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: your significant other, what? What's the environment like outside of that.

428
00:35:15.931 --> 00:35:20.149
Matthew Warner: We really don't talk about anybody. We talk to anybody else. So

429
00:35:20.610 --> 00:35:24.040
Matthew Warner: I really don't have no environment outside of that, just to be honest.

430
00:35:24.324 --> 00:35:27.890
Matthew Warner: Well, I'd like to get out of this house I live in because of

431
00:35:28.503 --> 00:35:32.180
Matthew Warner: the landlord won't do anything to it, nothing at all.

432
00:35:32.580 --> 00:35:36.699
Matthew Warner: and I don't know what to do about that, and

433
00:35:36.780 --> 00:35:40.890
Matthew Warner: other than the fact that they would make us move. And it's it's right close to Christmas.

434
00:35:41.400 --> 00:35:46.270
Matthew Warner: and but that has to change for me, I mean.

435
00:35:47.140 --> 00:35:52.240
Matthew Warner: cause I'm tired of doing it all, you know, and and nothing

436
00:35:52.300 --> 00:35:55.729
Matthew Warner: happening like we lost power in the front 2 bedrooms

437
00:35:55.830 --> 00:35:59.544
Matthew Warner: there last week. I really thought the house was going to catch fire

438
00:36:01.490 --> 00:36:03.229
Matthew Warner: the beginning of the week, so.

439
00:36:03.640 --> 00:36:05.680
Matthew Warner: and I can't get her to do anything.

440
00:36:06.140 --> 00:36:08.720
Matthew Warner: and and it it just sucks, you know.

441
00:36:09.550 --> 00:36:11.789
Matthew Warner: That's the only drawback I have right now.

442
00:36:13.520 --> 00:36:14.480
Matthew Warner: So.

443
00:36:15.060 --> 00:36:15.900
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: So.

444
00:36:16.320 --> 00:36:19.190
Matthew Warner: I know that, you know. Go ahead.

445
00:36:19.710 --> 00:36:29.030
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: Oh, I was just going to ask, how hard is it to to move to a different environment? Is that and a thing you can do fairly easily, or is that something that would take a little time.

446
00:36:30.417 --> 00:36:32.953
Matthew Warner: It would take some time to be honest.

447
00:36:33.540 --> 00:36:35.730
Matthew Warner: I'm waiting on my truck to get out of the shop

448
00:36:35.740 --> 00:36:39.329
Matthew Warner: so I can get back to work, and it's hard because I'm self employed

449
00:36:39.820 --> 00:36:50.050
Matthew Warner: to do anything over over Thanksgiving and Christmas, you know, and and the New Year. Nobody really wants you working on their house over that time, you know, they got family coming and stuff.

450
00:36:50.150 --> 00:36:57.020
Matthew Warner: So this is the slow season for me, and it always is so it will be

451
00:36:57.170 --> 00:37:00.289
Matthew Warner: into January before we can do anything. Really.

452
00:37:01.782 --> 00:37:03.889
Matthew Warner: We're looking at a couple of places

453
00:37:05.900 --> 00:37:13.662
Matthew Warner: to buy I'm trying to get set up with. The there's a program here in the State of Ohio that that

454
00:37:14.460 --> 00:37:16.770
Matthew Warner: does the down payment for you.

455
00:37:16.940 --> 00:37:24.430
Matthew Warner: And and I'm trying to figure that out and get that done which would be great.

456
00:37:27.430 --> 00:37:29.270
Matthew Warner: So that's where I'm at. With that

457
00:37:29.540 --> 00:37:32.729
Matthew Warner: that would be the only thing that would make me happier than I am

458
00:37:32.890 --> 00:37:38.409
Matthew Warner: would be for us to get out of this place where we live, and and even if we just rented another place

459
00:37:38.580 --> 00:37:46.690
Matthew Warner: until we could get a place ball would be wonderful for me, so.

460
00:37:47.430 --> 00:37:53.119
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: So you mentioned sobriety connections with family, and and finding a new place to live.

461
00:37:53.400 --> 00:37:59.870
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: Any any idea on which one comes first.st

462
00:38:01.390 --> 00:38:10.640
Matthew Warner: It's sobriety by far, by far, because without the sobriety nothing else will, nothing else will transpire. Period.

463
00:38:11.530 --> 00:38:12.420
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: And azure.

464
00:38:12.420 --> 00:38:13.429
Matthew Warner: One day at a time.

465
00:38:14.120 --> 00:38:16.660
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: And as it relates to your support system.

466
00:38:16.780 --> 00:38:20.820
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: talk to us a little bit about that. What does that look like for you? That ongoing support.

467
00:38:22.960 --> 00:38:27.760
Matthew Warner: Well, you know I got I got a psychiatrist that I see once a month

468
00:38:28.090 --> 00:38:33.530
Matthew Warner: I got MAT. Doctor that I see every 28 days for my brixoty shot.

469
00:38:33.650 --> 00:38:34.930
Matthew Warner: and that helps

470
00:38:36.970 --> 00:38:41.069
Matthew Warner: Then, emotionally, I got my family that we're working on.

471
00:38:42.840 --> 00:38:48.010
Matthew Warner: So I got all the support there that I need. You know

472
00:38:48.820 --> 00:38:56.239
Matthew Warner: it's just me to make it happen and still believe in myself, you know, and not lose sight of my ultimate goal.

473
00:38:57.780 --> 00:39:04.950
Matthew Warner: And it's it's as an addict of 30, 35 years being 50 years old, you know. It's

474
00:39:05.670 --> 00:39:08.809
Matthew Warner: it's a lot easier to say it than it is to do it.

475
00:39:09.250 --> 00:39:15.200
Matthew Warner: Now you put it like that, and it is, you know, close cause.

476
00:39:15.370 --> 00:39:21.189
Matthew Warner: It just is saying it and doing it is 2 different things, you know. So.

477
00:39:22.560 --> 00:39:24.900
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: For the for the rest of you here. Any

478
00:39:25.510 --> 00:39:28.249
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: advice or or thoughts, as you

479
00:39:28.590 --> 00:39:30.569
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: hear Matt talk about his goals.

480
00:39:47.620 --> 00:39:54.670
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: Stacy put in the chat I I heard of that. I will find out more info and forward on Stacy. What were you referring to

481
00:39:55.180 --> 00:39:56.070
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: with that?

482
00:40:10.840 --> 00:40:13.690
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: It's hard for everybody to find the mute and unmute button today.

483
00:40:15.120 --> 00:40:15.600
Matthew Warner: Yes.

484
00:40:15.600 --> 00:40:16.250
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: It doesn't always.

485
00:40:16.250 --> 00:40:17.870
Matthew Warner: Wondering if I was losing service.

486
00:40:18.500 --> 00:40:19.983
Matthew Warner: That call for the snow.

487
00:40:23.770 --> 00:40:26.210
Stacey Ford: Yeah, I think I'm unmuted now. Maybe.

488
00:40:26.210 --> 00:40:27.510
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: Now there you are! Now.

489
00:40:27.510 --> 00:40:31.690
Stacey Ford: I have a touch screen so I can touch it. So if I'm going like that

490
00:40:32.161 --> 00:40:36.479
Stacey Ford: I don't recall the second. No, I feel terrible. But

491
00:40:36.942 --> 00:40:51.850
Stacey Ford: there is. Oh, oh, there is help! Help in Ohio! That's what I was thinking of, something that you were talking about looking into. I I did recently hear about that. I am because I'm in Chicago, Illinois. Currently.

492
00:40:52.362 --> 00:40:54.170
Stacey Ford: Right now. Not not.

493
00:40:54.220 --> 00:40:59.499
Stacey Ford: Well, I don't know. I'm a snowbird up here. Does that make any sense but

494
00:40:59.880 --> 00:41:05.869
Stacey Ford: There is help there, and and you are correct. What you wanted to look into, Matt.

495
00:41:06.542 --> 00:41:14.989
Stacey Ford: I will send that to you because I did read a news article and and heard about what yours, what your

496
00:41:15.190 --> 00:41:18.570
Stacey Ford: talking about, so I can pass that forward to you.

497
00:41:19.640 --> 00:41:20.460
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: Yeah. Feel free.

498
00:41:20.460 --> 00:41:22.569
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: Feel free to share that in the chat. Stacy.

499
00:41:22.570 --> 00:41:25.120
Stacey Ford: Not just, Matt, but I mean to the group or.

500
00:41:25.120 --> 00:41:25.470
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: Yeah.

501
00:41:25.470 --> 00:41:26.280

Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: Also, I I want all of you to know that you'll

504
00:41:33.610 --> 00:41:41.309
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: even past, even though this is our final session today you'll still have access to Grove, and so you can still communicate with one another and

505
00:41:41.380 --> 00:41:46.990
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: and talk with talk with each other. If you'd like and share resources. So just know that

506
00:41:47.120 --> 00:41:49.800
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: that won't end after today.

507
00:41:51.190 --> 00:41:51.970
Matthew Warner: Okay.

508
00:41:52.270 --> 00:41:59.270
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: So any anything else, Matt, as you, as you look toward toward the future.

509
00:42:02.550 --> 00:42:10.620
Matthew Warner: That's my main goals, if I can make. If that if that happens, then I think everything else will come pretty easy from there, I mean.

510
00:42:10.680 --> 00:42:13.390
Matthew Warner: I really do. I believe that wholeheartedly.

511
00:42:13.610 --> 00:42:14.920
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: Indeed any.

512
00:42:14.920 --> 00:42:15.260
Matthew Warner: So.

513
00:42:15.260 --> 00:42:17.210
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: Any fear, any fears that you have.

514
00:42:19.980 --> 00:42:22.939
Matthew Warner: Just a relapse. That's the only fear I have.

515
00:42:23.040 --> 00:42:27.639
Matthew Warner: and and I don't want to. You know I've made up my mind that I'm done.

516
00:42:27.930 --> 00:42:34.849
Matthew Warner: But you know that monster's every time you let your guard down, it seems like you know.

517
00:42:35.130 --> 00:42:36.710
Matthew Warner: and that's just honesty.

518
00:42:38.410 --> 00:42:39.370
Matthew Warner: So.

519
00:42:39.790 --> 00:42:42.379
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: And azure. Do you have those?

520
00:42:43.240 --> 00:42:44.696
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: Do you have that?

521
00:42:46.130 --> 00:42:51.990
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: I guess, and and I'll I'll use the word scaffolding and and scaffolding supports is another.

522
00:42:52.100 --> 00:42:54.549
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: But do you, in the event that

523
00:42:57.080 --> 00:43:03.140
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: something triggers you or you? You think about that? Do you have the scaffolding or supports to help you.

524
00:43:05.770 --> 00:43:06.830
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: Yeah, that is.

525
00:43:07.600 --> 00:43:08.479
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: And that's with your phone.

526
00:43:08.480 --> 00:43:09.609
Matthew Warner: Yes, I do.

527
00:43:10.350 --> 00:43:15.860
Matthew Warner: Yes, with my family and my psychiatrist, and my regular and my position.

528
00:43:15.900 --> 00:43:24.349
Matthew Warner: You know my physician and my my primary care physician and my psychiatrist. I got through the rehab that I just graduated from.

529
00:43:24.970 --> 00:43:30.990
Matthew Warner: and they understand it, and if it gets too bad they got, you know they have resources for me.

530
00:43:31.570 --> 00:43:34.810
Matthew Warner: and they're there, and I know they're there. So.

531
00:43:36.500 --> 00:43:37.070
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: Okay.

532
00:43:37.070 --> 00:43:38.270
Matthew Warner: And and

533
00:43:38.400 --> 00:43:45.150
Matthew Warner: I I think I I believe that I can do it. You know I believe in myself. But, like I said, I take it one day at a time.

534
00:43:46.290 --> 00:43:47.170
Matthew Warner: so.

535
00:43:49.850 --> 00:43:51.300
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: Well, well, thanks, Matt.

536
00:43:52.012 --> 00:43:53.398
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: Anyone else any

537
00:43:54.460 --> 00:44:00.810
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: As as Matt moves forward with this, with this journey, any advice or or strategies that you'd like to share.

538
00:44:04.160 --> 00:44:12.359
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: and Gina will be back here in a moment. She is, she just sent a message that she's fixing her kids a plate to eat, and then she will be back here in a second

539
00:44:13.318 --> 00:44:16.809
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: Revetra, or or Stacy, where? What is?

540
00:44:17.300 --> 00:44:21.300
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: If we were to connect? If I were to see you at the.

541
00:44:21.590 --> 00:44:21.880
Stacey Ford: Stuff.

542
00:44:21.880 --> 00:44:28.860
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: Coffee shop, or shopping, or whatever 3 months from now, what would what would that look like?

543
00:44:29.210 --> 00:44:29.829
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: What would be.

544
00:44:29.830 --> 00:44:51.950
Stacey Ford: Well, I surely hope it's gonna be down in like Key West or in Florida. I mean, I'm not joking, because that's 3 3 months. I'm I'm thinking, less than a month. And I have a plan right now. I've got a roommate that is acceptable of my 2 little Pomeranian dogs. And

545
00:44:51.950 --> 00:45:08.859
Stacey Ford: I'm gonna walk them on the beach every sunrise and every sunset my 2 little dogs. And I'm gonna make money remotely working from home. And my goal is that to strengthen myself? That's been my life goal. Live in Florida, and I've lived there.

546
00:45:08.860 --> 00:45:33.980
Stacey Ford: and I've had all that. But I've never utilized it. I've always done everything for everybody else. So in in not even 3 months. But I'd say one and a half to 2 months is I'm gonna be so happy living life. I've always wanted to live and it's only a couple of hurdles I have to jump over, and that's it.

547
00:45:34.480 --> 00:45:38.359
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: So so name those hurdles. What are the the hurdles you? You're referring to?

548
00:45:38.360 --> 00:45:43.279
Stacey Ford: Okay, so I do not have a driver's license. I do. Well, I do. It's

549
00:45:44.330 --> 00:45:51.217
Stacey Ford: you don't have time for this. But I do in Florida and any other State but Illinois.

550
00:45:52.170 --> 00:46:05.100
Stacey Ford: Florida. I walk into the Zmv. They will hand that to me, so that's 1 hurdle is me getting myself my 2 dogs and my belongings back down to Florida.

551
00:46:05.554 --> 00:46:16.869
Stacey Ford: That's a huge hurdle, but it makes more sense, you know. I mean I if I'm I'm thinking, fly down to Florida. It's like I've been thinking. This

552
00:46:17.110 --> 00:46:23.119
Stacey Ford: Illinois finally released the hole for 10 years. I've not been able to drive for 10 years.

553
00:46:23.260 --> 00:46:33.650
Stacey Ford: and I completed everything in the 1st 6 months in Florida but Illinois. I know I never came back to Illinois, regarding

554
00:46:33.720 --> 00:46:45.859
Stacey Ford: that it was just back and forth like tennis. And and this is not what the groups about. But anyway, so walking to me get my driver license there. So that's a hurdle.

555
00:46:46.100 --> 00:46:52.900
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: Yeah. So hurdle one is the getting a driver's license so you can get back to Florida is hurdle.

556
00:46:52.900 --> 00:46:54.420
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: And what's what's hurdle 2.

557
00:46:55.447 --> 00:47:09.109
Stacey Ford: Well, I have my 2 dogs that if I didn't have 2 little dogs it won't be so difficult. I could jump on a plane. Go there, get my license to come back, but I don't have the help to with my dogs.

558
00:47:09.759 --> 00:47:12.659
Stacey Ford: So that's a big hurdle.

559
00:47:13.510 --> 00:47:16.310
Stacey Ford: Do you mean? What is another goal?

560
00:47:16.575 --> 00:47:20.289
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: No, you you just mentioned a couple of hurdles, so I was just clarifying

561
00:47:20.930 --> 00:47:26.630
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: what? Those were. So getting your driver's license, and then getting the dogs down to.

562
00:47:26.630 --> 00:47:52.530
Stacey Ford: Getting back to Florida. I'm I'm it's it's it is so cold here it's ridiculously cold. I don't want to be here. I mean, I have, you know, a roommate, and that I can move in and live on the ocean, on the beach, and with my dogs, and be happy. And that's my goal. Short term, long term.

563
00:47:53.560 --> 00:48:00.480
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: Is there? So I so did. Did you leave your license down in Florida, or.

564
00:48:01.880 --> 00:48:03.600
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: Or you need a new one.

565
00:48:04.020 --> 00:48:23.059
Stacey Ford: I need to get it in in Florida. I need to either have somebody watch my dogs. Now fly down there, get my license walk in the Dmv. It's Illinois released the hold off of it, but I signed it off saying I wasn't moving back to Illinois, and I'm not.

566
00:48:23.260 --> 00:48:28.169
Stacey Ford: And that happened while all this was happening with my brother

567
00:48:28.890 --> 00:48:33.499
Stacey Ford: in less 3 3 months. Well, since July. Yes.

568
00:48:34.150 --> 00:48:41.169
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: So how close are you? You may have mentioned this. I'm sorry if I missed it. But, how how close are you to getting your license there in Illinois.

569
00:48:41.550 --> 00:48:56.639
Stacey Ford: Illinois, they say I'm done, they'll give it to me, but I have to. Do. Sr. 22 proof or whatnot, and whatever they need me to do when I don't have a vehicle

570
00:48:56.860 --> 00:49:03.290
Stacey Ford: to get insurance to go into the Dmv. And then

571
00:49:04.051 --> 00:49:07.360
Stacey Ford: but yes, Illinois, it's they.

572
00:49:07.930 --> 00:49:17.730
Stacey Ford: I'm not revoked. I'm not suspended. Nothing, and I and I should have never done any of it, and I did complete. I had a dui, and I completed it.

573
00:49:17.820 --> 00:49:21.740
Stacey Ford: But during when that happened to me, that was

574
00:49:22.215 --> 00:49:33.269
Stacey Ford: when my mother had a fatal accident and she passed my dad. And so we're going from 2,000. And was it, you know, around 12?

575
00:49:34.380 --> 00:49:37.460
Stacey Ford: So that's where we come into the 10 year period.

576
00:49:37.888 --> 00:49:51.299
Stacey Ford: And it was it was more. I I just ubered everywhere and let it go. And I didn't want to battle. I'm in Florida, Illinois is a problem. Illinois is a problem not Florida. Florida has no problem with me, Florida. Give it to me.

577
00:49:52.070 --> 00:49:59.251
Stacey Ford: totally. Give it to me, the Safety Council. I am. They know me by my middle name and

578
00:50:00.010 --> 00:50:10.909
Stacey Ford: and I have nothing on my driving record nothing except the Dui, and it's horrible what I went through. But I did, and I'm over it. And now I'm

579
00:50:10.920 --> 00:50:26.519
Stacey Ford: I'm that's the hurdle that I have is to get me and my dogs my belongings down there to Florida in the next month to have a house or apartment there, on the beach, or or near.

580
00:50:27.580 --> 00:50:28.225
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: So

581
00:50:29.110 --> 00:50:35.649
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: so this goal of getting back to Florida, that's an achievable one. It sounds like you'll be able to to do that.

582
00:50:36.340 --> 00:50:37.170
Stacey Ford: Yes.

583
00:50:37.170 --> 00:50:42.630
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: Okay. So once, once you're down there in Florida, how does

584
00:50:42.670 --> 00:50:45.930
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: how do things change for you? What what looks different?

585
00:50:46.470 --> 00:50:48.959
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: Besides, the geographic landscape.

586
00:50:48.960 --> 00:51:00.330
Stacey Ford: The sun shines every day. I'm happy. I wake up, and I thank the Lord about just like how blessed I am. That's what I've done throughout the years.

587
00:51:00.480 --> 00:51:08.709
Stacey Ford: and since I've been here in Chicago I miserable, miserable. I mean, we got great food that's about it.

588
00:51:08.780 --> 00:51:17.090
Stacey Ford: And yeah, you know, I mean, I could have the same relationships with people on Facebook

589
00:51:17.580 --> 00:51:19.699
Stacey Ford: as I do here.

590
00:51:19.720 --> 00:51:26.649
Stacey Ford: You know I there's no reason for me to. I I don't like anything about it here at all.

591
00:51:26.800 --> 00:51:31.310
Stacey Ford: And my brother is okay. Now, thank God

592
00:51:31.410 --> 00:51:47.670
Stacey Ford: and I'm I feel like my job is done, and I feel like I need to now focus on myself, get back to Florida and wake up every day and smile and be happy because I'm not here at all.

593
00:51:48.580 --> 00:51:54.420
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: Florida. It sounds like it. It's upcoming, but it'll be a little bit. How do you take care of yourself? In the meantime.

594
00:51:54.500 --> 00:51:58.069
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: like what are some things that that you can do to.

595
00:51:58.730 --> 00:52:18.479
Stacey Ford: Well, in the meantime, I'm I'm kind of minimizing. I'm I'm I have a lot of clothes and separating you know, donating and keeping and giving away type stuff, splitting them up. And and then, you know, you're packing them set to tighten them up small.

596
00:52:18.510 --> 00:52:24.504
Stacey Ford: And so I'm minimizing and then going back? And

597
00:52:25.620 --> 00:52:30.020
Stacey Ford: I don't know. I mean, what do you mean? How am I taking care of myself?

598
00:52:30.890 --> 00:52:33.179
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: Like? What are? What are you doing for you are, are there.

599
00:52:33.180 --> 00:52:36.130
Stacey Ford: I am reading this book. It's called

600
00:52:37.230 --> 00:52:42.774
Stacey Ford: Salty Piece of Land, Jimmy Buffett and

601
00:52:45.935 --> 00:52:51.499
Stacey Ford: this there! There is a guy that you know that

602
00:52:51.600 --> 00:53:19.300
Stacey Ford: my sister knew very well down in Jacksonville, and he is kind of like Mayor of Jacksonville. Everyone knows him, but anyways he he actually happened to be the last person that ever spoken spoke to my sister when she went missing, she went missing from Key West with that being said, is that my friend Wally that's his name, had called my sister, spoken to her and told her to read this book

603
00:53:19.340 --> 00:53:33.990
Stacey Ford: and encouraged her to, and I've been curious about it. Wally just contacted me, and I'm like Wally, what is the name of that book? I want to read the book. So this is the book, and I'm going to read it.

604
00:53:34.250 --> 00:53:37.119
Stacey Ford: And she was the

605
00:53:38.150 --> 00:53:50.880
Stacey Ford: I love Jimmy Buffett, who does not love Jimmy Jimmy Buffett. But our friend Wally was last one that spoke to my sister, and this is what their conversation was. So I want to read this book.

606
00:53:53.020 --> 00:54:02.449
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: What about your your supports like your support system there in Chicago versus your support system in in Florida? What? What does that look like?

607
00:54:02.650 --> 00:54:08.150
Stacey Ford: Oh, gosh! I have it nationwide if I want it, I don't utilize it.

608
00:54:09.590 --> 00:54:13.439
Stacey Ford: I don't. I do the healthcare system because I need it.

609
00:54:14.380 --> 00:54:22.950
Stacey Ford: But I, my girlfriends, are my best friend. Best, best friends that I talk to daily are in

610
00:54:22.960 --> 00:54:28.950
Stacey Ford: Texas, Florida, Nevada, you know Wisconsin.

611
00:54:29.300 --> 00:54:37.570
Stacey Ford: and they are like speed dials, speed dials. And unfortunately, I have not been speaking to anyone for

612
00:54:37.810 --> 00:54:43.649
Stacey Ford: the last 6 months. I'm just kind of feeling dead just, I'm just numb. I'm just

613
00:54:44.780 --> 00:54:48.000
Stacey Ford: done and sick of it all. That's how I feel.

614
00:54:48.010 --> 00:54:51.520
Stacey Ford: And so I'm

615
00:54:52.870 --> 00:54:59.579
Stacey Ford: and it's so cold. And for me to use my phone, which I have Xfinity Internet and

616
00:54:59.600 --> 00:55:11.820
Stacey Ford: T-mobile and Verizon. And I'm not in the mountains or whatever for me to use my phone. I have to get dressed up and go outside to use my phone because the

617
00:55:13.370 --> 00:55:16.290
Stacey Ford: the phone signal and it's ridiculous.

618
00:55:18.597 --> 00:55:33.870
Stacey Ford: I mean, we have great Wi-fi and whatnot. But regarding like my telephone service to talk to my girlfriend. It'd be easier to text, and it might go through in a day or whatever, and I'm not even in the mountains, or you know.

619
00:55:35.260 --> 00:55:39.690
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: So similar to to Matt. You're looking at environment change.

620
00:55:40.345 --> 00:55:45.949
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: Are looking forward forward to that for any of you, Revetra, or I think, Gina?

621
00:55:46.920 --> 00:55:49.690
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: She was on for 2 seconds, and I think she jumped off again.

622
00:55:53.640 --> 00:56:00.090
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: Matt, or Rebecca or Revetra, as you're listening to to Stacey any any thoughts or

623
00:56:01.240 --> 00:56:04.839
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: strategies come to mind that you could offer her.

624
00:56:07.610 --> 00:56:19.509
Ravettra Ford: For me physical fitness. And also I just get the hurdle of the driver's license.

625
00:56:20.505 --> 00:56:29.150
Ravettra Ford: Thing. I felt like I was in like a twilight zone of stuck on

626
00:56:29.400 --> 00:56:38.170
Ravettra Ford: learners permit because I couldn't ever get a road skills test scheduled. And finally.

627
00:56:38.320 --> 00:56:42.730
Ravettra Ford: they have what's called a walk in Wednesday.

628
00:56:42.970 --> 00:56:58.379
Ravettra Ford: so I had to have a license driver with me at our Department of Homeland Security here. So it's my mom. We had to ride like Super early, because the line could wrap

629
00:56:58.430 --> 00:57:02.379
Ravettra Ford: around the building like really swiftly.

630
00:57:02.430 --> 00:57:11.200
Ravettra Ford: So with that being said, we got up there early. It was approximately 7 other people in front of me.

631
00:57:11.240 --> 00:57:17.719
Ravettra Ford: So it was like Yay, because I have been trying since April

632
00:57:17.730 --> 00:57:23.869
Ravettra Ford: of this year of trying to call trying to go online

633
00:57:24.100 --> 00:57:32.330
Ravettra Ford: would to no end. I could get anything scheduled. So the walk in Wednesday worked out for me, even though

634
00:57:32.550 --> 00:57:44.299
Ravettra Ford: we had to go up there at 4 Am. And they didn't even open until 8 am. So now I do have my driver's license, and I'm able

635
00:57:44.410 --> 00:57:47.600
Ravettra Ford: to. I'm in the market now of trying to

636
00:57:48.591 --> 00:57:55.500
Ravettra Ford: secure an automobile because I've been ubering and lifting everywhere. So I'll be able to go

637
00:57:55.770 --> 00:58:03.409
Ravettra Ford: to the gym. Physical fitness. My yoga mat came in today that I ordered from Amazon.

638
00:58:03.450 --> 00:58:12.660
Ravettra Ford: So 3 months from now I can see myself being is go physically fit again

639
00:58:12.870 --> 00:58:17.750
Ravettra Ford: because they've been just drafting out of my account.

640
00:58:18.516 --> 00:58:27.170
Ravettra Ford: Planet fitness like monthly. And I I haven't been utilizing my membership at all, because

641
00:58:27.615 --> 00:58:29.630
Ravettra Ford: you know, I've been in pain

642
00:58:30.210 --> 00:58:33.849
Ravettra Ford: so 3 months. That's a goal of mine

643
00:58:33.890 --> 00:58:38.670
Ravettra Ford: to be in the gym physically fit.

644
00:58:39.950 --> 00:58:46.340
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: Roberta, you just you just described a a scenario where? You combined that

645
00:58:47.290 --> 00:58:52.119
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: physical fitness and getting a driver's license, which I think is really really cool. Stacy did.

646
00:58:52.720 --> 00:58:53.320
Ravettra Ford: Exactly.

647
00:58:53.420 --> 00:58:58.909
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: Stacey, as you heard that. Was there anything that resonated with you that

648
00:58:59.440 --> 00:59:02.450
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: might be able to help speed up that process for you?

649
00:59:03.080 --> 00:59:13.579
Stacey Ford: For me. It's it's already happened. All I have to do is step my foot into the land of Florida and walk into Dmv. And there's my license.

650
00:59:14.020 --> 00:59:35.009
Stacey Ford: that's it. But I have 2 little tiny dogs, and I'm I can't fly with both of them and my blind. So that's where it comes into me. Moving with them, or I can't even let anyone watch them. They're they're little people. They're not just dogs.

651
00:59:35.720 --> 00:59:39.420
Stacey Ford: So what resonates with me is, I totally

652
00:59:39.670 --> 00:59:42.390
Stacey Ford: understand and relate to all that. Yes.

653
00:59:42.880 --> 00:59:45.600
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: Do you have any any friends, or.

654
00:59:45.600 --> 00:59:52.880
Matthew Warner: I understand the dog thing because I have one. Her name's pumpkin Pie, and she's half Maltese and half Chihuahua.

655
00:59:53.170 --> 00:59:55.180
Matthew Warner: and and she's a person.

656
00:59:55.230 --> 00:59:57.070
Matthew Warner: I take her everywhere I go.

657
00:59:57.640 --> 01:00:00.249
Stacey Ford: And everyone probably loves her.

658
01:00:01.390 --> 01:00:11.220
Matthew Warner: Yeah, she's mean. She's Chihuahua, and she'll bite you. She bites everybody, but she's she's 9 pounds of fury.

659
01:00:11.522 --> 01:00:13.357
Matthew Warner: That's what I say. All the time.

660
01:00:13.940 --> 01:00:21.040
Matthew Warner: She's cute as a button, but she's mean, and but I I guess I'm gonna get papers

661
01:00:21.110 --> 01:00:24.709
Matthew Warner: for her service dog papers for emotional support.

662
01:00:25.140 --> 01:00:30.699
Matthew Warner: So that way I can take them. You know. They can ride. She can ride with me anywhere. I go.

663
01:00:31.390 --> 01:00:32.890
Stacey Ford: That's really interesting.

664
01:00:33.120 --> 01:00:34.040
Matthew Warner: Wanna look into that.

665
01:00:34.570 --> 01:00:38.440
Stacey Ford: That's really easy, and I will forward that information, too, as well.

666
01:00:39.970 --> 01:00:43.199
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: Is is that is that something you can do, Stacy, can you.

667
01:00:43.200 --> 01:00:49.700
Stacey Ford: Yes, yes, because I I've already looked into that. And yes, absolutely

668
01:00:50.447 --> 01:01:01.849
Stacey Ford: I am so deep into the knowledge regarding having a social dog? Yes, so how long?

669
01:01:02.020 --> 01:01:06.120
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: How long does that process take to from start

670
01:01:06.120 --> 01:01:08.219
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: to finish to get that done?

671
01:01:09.233 --> 01:01:13.460
Stacey Ford: A couple of weeks, just maybe less.

672
01:01:14.620 --> 01:01:15.140
Stacey Ford: Want to.

673
01:01:15.140 --> 01:01:16.959
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: Matt, is that how long it took for you.

674
01:01:18.740 --> 01:01:21.590
Matthew Warner: I haven't done it yet. I don't know. I haven't even looked into it.

675
01:01:21.780 --> 01:01:24.759
Matthew Warner: I took her. I I took her into a

676
01:01:25.220 --> 01:01:32.670
Matthew Warner: one of my appointments that I had, and and they said that I couldn't bring her in, and then I told him, Well, if she can't come, I can't come.

677
01:01:33.120 --> 01:01:36.090
Matthew Warner: And they said, Well, you gotta get papers for so

678
01:01:37.520 --> 01:01:41.389
Matthew Warner: I left, and I haven't looked into it yet. It didn't go no further.

679
01:01:41.750 --> 01:01:44.490
Matthew Warner: Okay, I think I don't know if it costs money or not.

680
01:01:44.774 --> 01:01:46.969
Matthew Warner: But it's something I'm going to look into.

681
01:01:47.820 --> 01:01:51.680
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: And and Stacy, what prevents you from taking the dogs on an airplane?

682
01:01:52.300 --> 01:02:08.530
Stacey Ford: With everything that I own, and them and myself, and living a lot. That's a lot of work, I mean my dogs. I have anxiety. I don't want to fly my! My dogs. That would be insane.

683
01:02:08.690 --> 01:02:09.310
Stacey Ford: and.

684
01:02:09.310 --> 01:02:13.330
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: So it's not. It's not just a matter of going home. All of your stuff is there, too?

685
01:02:13.865 --> 01:02:14.399
Stacey Ford: Correct.

686
01:02:14.400 --> 01:02:17.019
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: So all of your all of your belongings are in Chicago.

687
01:02:17.020 --> 01:02:25.760
Stacey Ford: Correct, correct. But you know now that you brought that up, I mean, and I'm open minded. I could fly with them.

688
01:02:25.790 --> 01:02:33.079
Stacey Ford: I'm I'm going there, and I'm getting my my place in the next 6 weeks or whatnot.

689
01:02:35.570 --> 01:02:43.200
Stacey Ford: So I'm trying to figure out a solution with that. And I don't know.

690
01:02:45.440 --> 01:02:46.700
Stacey Ford: I don't know.

691
01:02:49.580 --> 01:02:54.550
Stacey Ford: Do you wanna meet him? You guys wanna meet him, Abby? Abby.

692
01:02:55.260 --> 01:03:00.640
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: Yeah, we're always always happy to to see pets on the screen. That's always a good thing.

693
01:03:01.960 --> 01:03:07.849
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: Ravetra. When you you were you were talking. You were providing some advice for

694
01:03:07.880 --> 01:03:11.302
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: Stacy, but you were also. You also mentioned

695
01:03:12.370 --> 01:03:15.139
Stacey Ford: Something that if we were to look long, term.

696
01:03:15.370 --> 01:03:19.349
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: That you were interested in. What does that? What does that look like for you? If we were to

697
01:03:20.050 --> 01:03:22.370
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: reconnect somewhere, and I would see you.

698
01:03:23.570 --> 01:03:26.370
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: What does that look like for you? Specifically, Revetra.

699
01:03:28.340 --> 01:03:38.529
Ravettra Ford: It's ironic that I know I I'm not for sure if Stacy was born and raised in Florida.

700
01:03:38.650 --> 01:03:42.550
Ravettra Ford: But Florida, is a place where

701
01:03:42.840 --> 01:03:54.350
Ravettra Ford: my daughter she actually went to school. There she attended embry Riddle, aeronautical University in Daytona Beach, Florida, and

702
01:03:54.620 --> 01:04:06.229
Ravettra Ford: it took us like each day after we were just supposed to drop her off like, set her up in her dormitory room and leave after we set her up. But

703
01:04:06.290 --> 01:04:08.580
Ravettra Ford: it had a beach there, of course.

704
01:04:08.630 --> 01:04:16.350
Ravettra Ford: so each day we would call downstairs and tell them we would extend. We wanted another night.

705
01:04:16.390 --> 01:04:28.170
Ravettra Ford: Then the next night it became another night and the next night, and so it was became ridiculous to like, Okay, so we gotta stop this. We gotta go ahead and get back to Memphis.

706
01:04:28.340 --> 01:04:37.220
Ravettra Ford: But we fell in love with Florida. I get it about with the weather, so I'm thinking, like

707
01:04:37.960 --> 01:04:42.370
Ravettra Ford: the relocation idea when she's talking about it.

708
01:04:42.430 --> 01:04:56.970
Ravettra Ford: It would be a bit much. But I'm I'm gonna be so happy for her and her pets, and she getting her things and everything, and her place

709
01:04:58.115 --> 01:05:03.649
Ravettra Ford: and getting settled in, so to speak, and I know it's a process

710
01:05:04.090 --> 01:05:07.940
Ravettra Ford: like anything else, and it takes time

711
01:05:08.170 --> 01:05:20.020
Ravettra Ford: and patience like the steps that I did so ping me and reconnecting

712
01:05:22.280 --> 01:05:24.820
Ravettra Ford: like you said in a coffee shop.

713
01:05:27.320 --> 01:05:36.220
Ravettra Ford: I I want to think and believe in success, seeing it happen.

714
01:05:37.320 --> 01:05:38.240
Stacey Ford: So.

715
01:05:39.040 --> 01:05:47.760
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: What does continued growth look like for you or Metro, then are you? Are you relocating to Florida, too, or is is that your plan, or what? What is your

716
01:05:48.070 --> 01:05:49.890
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: what? What are you thinking about?

717
01:05:50.560 --> 01:05:55.500
Ravettra Ford: Well, not within the next 3 months per se.

718
01:05:55.730 --> 01:06:15.890
Ravettra Ford: I was thinking more so. My, that was my plan, for, like within the next 3 to 5 years. Not the next 3 months. Definitely. Not the hurricanes kinda like scared that off. They kind of my timeline out for sure.

719
01:06:16.800 --> 01:06:21.599
Ravettra Ford: With that he kind of scared me out on that.

720
01:06:22.040 --> 01:06:26.270
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: So what? So what have been your thoughts about continued growth like what? What does that?

721
01:06:27.310 --> 01:06:28.820
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: What does that look like for you?

722
01:06:29.980 --> 01:06:36.959
Ravettra Ford: Okay. So in regards to my health, wise being physically fit

723
01:06:37.480 --> 01:06:41.100
Ravettra Ford: the most difficult part for me.

724
01:06:41.150 --> 01:06:45.060
Ravettra Ford: It's like getting started.

725
01:06:45.550 --> 01:06:52.339
Ravettra Ford: However, once I get started on my physical fitness.

726
01:06:52.700 --> 01:06:58.759
Ravettra Ford: I'm like military style on myself, and

727
01:06:59.060 --> 01:07:07.930
Ravettra Ford: when I don't get to go, or if something comes up, it's like I feel totally bad about it. And I'm gonna have

728
01:07:08.120 --> 01:07:16.479
Ravettra Ford: I tried my what? Best to make it up as soon as possible, even if it's not like

729
01:07:17.833 --> 01:07:22.000
Ravettra Ford: my exact structure, schedule length.

730
01:07:23.250 --> 01:07:23.880
Stacey Ford: Fine.

731
01:07:24.470 --> 01:07:30.259
Ravettra Ford: Let's say what I mean by that. Let's say I have 45 min scheduled.

732
01:07:30.730 --> 01:07:37.740
Ravettra Ford: However, something comes up, and I'm not able to do the entire 45 min

733
01:07:37.870 --> 01:07:50.410
Ravettra Ford: if I can just go in and get 15 to 20 min in. Then I'm satisfied with that. But if I can't get anything in. Then. I

734
01:07:50.550 --> 01:07:53.940
Ravettra Ford: would tend to feel really bad and

735
01:07:54.350 --> 01:07:57.989
Ravettra Ford: upset with myself when I can't.

736
01:07:58.860 --> 01:08:01.030
Ravettra Ford: Once I'm in it.

737
01:08:01.360 --> 01:08:05.900
Ravettra Ford: I'm totally committed to my physical fitness plan.

738
01:08:05.960 --> 01:08:15.679
Ravettra Ford: So that's what continued growth looks like for me. And I I take photographs of my progress.

739
01:08:16.434 --> 01:08:20.340
Ravettra Ford: I keep a food log of what I'm eating.

740
01:08:20.550 --> 01:08:21.410
Ravettra Ford: I

741
01:08:22.340 --> 01:08:24.939
Ravettra Ford: Also I'll weigh myself.

742
01:08:26.696 --> 01:08:33.569
Ravettra Ford: Not daily, but I'll do it weekly to see how that looks.

743
01:08:34.279 --> 01:08:35.270
Stacey Ford: And.

744
01:08:35.270 --> 01:08:36.770
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: That was my next question is,

745
01:08:37.370 --> 01:08:38.430
Ravettra Ford: Me!

746
01:08:38.439 --> 01:08:41.249
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: How do you? How do you measure your progress?

747
01:08:42.579 --> 01:08:47.339
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: What? Where are you not at right now, as it relates to your to your physical activity?

748
01:08:49.149 --> 01:08:58.129
Ravettra Ford: I'm not there right now, because I'm trying to. Basically figure out well, I'm trying to get my pain

749
01:09:00.319 --> 01:09:09.969
Ravettra Ford: level to where it's tolerable. And of course.

750
01:09:10.749 --> 01:09:17.149
Ravettra Ford: all of this time I was basically experiencing gout.

751
01:09:17.189 --> 01:09:22.929
Ravettra Ford: But I didn't have knowledge of that. What it was on top of

752
01:09:22.989 --> 01:09:28.739
Ravettra Ford: my osteoarthritis and my diabetic neuropathy.

753
01:09:28.999 --> 01:09:36.949
Ravettra Ford: However, now, since I have a medical diagnosis for it, and I have the medication for it.

754
01:09:37.379 --> 01:09:45.439
Ravettra Ford: and now in my body, and I know my treatment plan. I have a treatment plan for it.

755
01:09:45.489 --> 01:09:50.269
Ravettra Ford: Moving forward, I feel like I can be a success.

756
01:09:52.460 --> 01:09:55.830

Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: So we're going to start wrapping up here and.

Stacey Ford: And one.

773
01:11:01.070 --> 01:11:05.599
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: One way that we wrap up this session. These sessions is really talking about

774
01:11:05.800 --> 01:11:08.829
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: what you learned, and if there was

775
01:11:09.260 --> 01:11:16.330
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: something you heard from someone in this group particularly. That's on. Now that really stuck with you.

776
01:11:16.838 --> 01:11:19.629
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: I just. I did receive a note that

777
01:11:19.810 --> 01:11:26.609
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: that Shannon is in the car for a while longer, and will not be able to to reconnect that way. And then Gina said.

778
01:11:26.990 --> 01:11:32.490
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: she is tending to her kids. So that's causing some interruptions, but, like I mentioned before.

779
01:11:32.540 --> 01:11:38.150
Travis Rickford - LiveWell Northwest Kansas: you all have access to Grove, and so you can all communicate via that as well, and and get each other's contacts.

780
01:11:38.150 --> 01:11:44.610
Stacey Ford: That's a question. That's a question. Is that gonna remain up? I mean, okay.

782
01:11:46.750 --> 01:11:50.899
Stacey Ford: I mean I I can't say I've used it, but people may need to use it.

783
01:11:51.820 --> 01:11:52.740
Matthew Warner: Yeah.

784
01:11:54.040 --> 01:11:54.889

Stacey Ford: I have. I have. I have a problem of talking a lot, and I'm trying not to. But it's like I feel like if I don't say it, then you're not gonna hear it. And I I Travis, I think it'd be nice if you know the grove app could be open for socially to be able to communicate. Because we, you know, as a small group or whatnot like that, I think it would be great, or maybe helpful.

841
01:18:54.730 --> 01:19:16.199
Stacey Ford: perhaps, for Matthew. Maybe not. And if Matthew says No, or you know, says no or whatnot, and and Shann, I worry about her, and and the other girls too. So it and you did say it is going to be up and live, and whatnot. I think I think that would be great.
